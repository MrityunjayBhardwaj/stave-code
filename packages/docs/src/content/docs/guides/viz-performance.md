title: Writing fast viz sketches
description: How to keep p5/hydra visualizers smooth — grounded in measured Stave profiler data, not folklore.
---

By default Stave renders each visualizer in an **OffscreenCanvas Web Worker**,
off the main thread — so a heavy `draw()` no longer starves the audio scheduler.
But the cost doesn't vanish: a slow sketch still drops its own frames, and on a
browser that can't offload (or when the worker path is off) the visualizer falls
back to the **main thread**, where a heavy `draw()` *can* starve the scheduler
and put audio timing at risk. Either way, the segment budget below is what keeps
a sketch smooth. This guide is the short, *measured* version. Every number here
came from the Stave profiler (`Alt+P`) and the cost-curve matrix harness — not
from intuition. (For how the worker path works under the hood, see
[The viz renderer contract](/architecture/renderer-contract/).)

## What Stave handles for you (and what it can't)

The runtime now degrades **gracefully** under load, so a momentarily heavy scene
doesn't have to mean a janky editor or dropped audio. Three protections run
automatically:

- **Adaptive performance** (on by default — *Settings → Adaptive performance*).
  When frames actually start dropping, Stave's GPU-budget governor throttles each
  visualizer's rate, round-robins which ones draw on a given frame, and — under
  sustained pressure — drops their render resolution. It's a **no-op until things
  actually jank**, so a smooth 1–2 viz scene is untouched. This protects the
  *editor's* smoothness when many heavy viz saturate the GPU.
- **Quality mode** (*Settings → Viz quality*: High / Balanced / Performance) lets
  you trade fidelity for headroom up front — it scales both render resolution
  **and** sketch density (segment count), the only lever that helps the
  CPU-tessellation line meshes below.
- **Shared sampling.** Many *light* visualizers no longer each re-read the audio
  analyser on the main thread — they share one read per frame, which keeps the
  audio scheduler healthy when you stack a lot of small viz.

What none of these can do is make a **single** sketch that draws too much per frame
cheap — the governor can only thin an already-overloaded scene, and quality mode
trades away fidelity. For a sketch that's heavy on its own, the segment budget below
is still the rule. Think of it as: *write to the budget; let Adaptive performance
catch the overflow.*

## The one rule that matters: count your line segments

For a sketch that draws a wireframe / mesh / many strokes, frame cost is
**linear in the number of line segments drawn per frame**, and almost nothing
else. Measured on a WEBGL terrain (`segments = rows·(cols−1) + cols·(rows−1)`):

| segments / frame | frame p95 | fps | scheduler |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 9 850 | 99 ms | 11 | starved (trig/s 8.4 → 5.8) |
| 4 900 | 54 ms | 20 | recovering |
| 2 920 | 37 ms | 28 | **healthy (trig/s 8.4, 0 long-tasks)** |
| 1 450 | 22 ms | 47 | healthy |

Rule of thumb: `frame_ms ≈ 9 + 0.0092 × segments`. **Keep a single instance
under ~3 000 segments** and it stops blocking audio. Halve your history depth or
column count and you halve the cost — directly.

p5 builds quad geometry for every thick-line segment **on the CPU** before
sending it to the GPU. That CPU tessellation is the cost. It scales with how
many segments you draw, full stop.

## What does NOT help (measured — don't waste time on these)

These are intuitive "optimizations" that the profiler shows do **nothing** (or
backfire) for CPU-tessellation-bound line meshes:

- **Batching `beginShape(LINES)`** to cut draw calls — *regresses* ~10%. The cost
  is per-segment, not per-call; batching to `LINES` doubles your segment count.
- **Retained `p5.Geometry`** — no help if the mesh changes every frame (e.g. a
  scrolling waveform). p5 re-tessellates a changed geometry each frame anyway.
- **Thinner `strokeWeight`** — p5 has no cheap thin-line path; even sub-1px lines
  tessellate to quads.
- **Lower resolution / smaller canvas** — *no effect at all* for line meshes.
  This cost is CPU, not pixels/fragments. (Resolution only helps fill-heavy or
  shader-heavy sketches.)
- **`POINTS` instead of lines** — *worse*, not better.

The only sketch-level lever is **drawing fewer segments**.

## Practical checklist

1. **Decimate.** Cap history length and grid density. A 50×30 mesh reads almost
   identically to 100×50 but costs a third as much. Draw only the rows *or* the
   columns of a grid, not both, when one direction carries the shape.
2. **Reuse buffers — never allocate in `draw()`.** Hoist analyser buffers to
   module scope and re-allocate only when the size changes:
   ```js
   let _wave = null
   function draw() {
     if (stave.analyser) {
       const n = stave.analyser.frequencyBinCount
       if (!_wave || _wave.length !== n) _wave = new Float32Array(n)
       stave.analyser.getFloatTimeDomainData(_wave)
       // …use _wave…
     }
   }
   ```
   (This is GC hygiene — the profiler shows the per-frame buffer cost itself is
   tiny, but it's the right habit and it's how the built-in `scope`/`fscope`/
   `spectrum` sketches are written. The *frame* cost lives in the drawing, above.)
3. **Read the analyser once per frame.** Don't call `getFloatTimeDomainData`
   twice — read into one buffer and share the result.
4. **Measure, don't guess.** Open the overlay with **`Alt+P`**. Watch
   **frame p95** and **long-tasks**, not mean fps (a uniformly-slow sketch shows
   0 dropped frames but still janks). If **`trig/s`** falls as you add viz, your
   sketch is choking the audio scheduler — decimate until it recovers.

## Where the work runs, and why the budget still holds

Audio DSP already runs off-thread (Web Audio / AudioWorklet). The renderer now
runs in an **OffscreenCanvas worker** by default, so viz `draw()` no longer
shares the main thread with the scheduler — that's the big win. Two reasons the
segment budget still matters:

- **Fallback.** On a browser that can't offload (no OffscreenCanvas /
  `transferControlToOffscreen`), or with the worker path disabled, the visualizer
  runs on the **main thread** — and there the scheduler tolerates jank only up to
  its look-ahead margin, so a `draw()` that blocks longer drops audio events.
- **The cost doesn't disappear off-thread.** A worker sketch over budget simply
  drops its own frames (under backpressure the worker's effective rate *is* its
  draw rate). The profiler bridges that cost back as the `viz.worker.draw`
  section — so `Alt+P` shows it whether the sketch runs on the worker or the main
  thread.

Decimate to the budget and the sketch is smooth on both paths. For the worker
architecture itself, see
[The viz renderer contract](/architecture/renderer-contract/).
