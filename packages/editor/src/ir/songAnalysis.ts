/**
 * songAnalysis — full-song analysis for the navigable timeline (#385).
 *
 * Re-expresses the reference editor's `analyze`/`attribute` capabilities on
 * top of our IR: query the evaluated pattern over a PROGRESSIVE horizon
 * (hint-seeded, doubling to a cap) in budget-bounded slices, accumulate
 * per-lane onset activity, detect the loop PERIOD from per-cycle fingerprints,
 * and partition the horizon into SECTIONS by active-lane signature.
 *
 * Design SoT: VISUAL-EDITING-AND-SCRUB-DESIGN.md §7.5. Runs off the in-memory
 * IR and NEVER calls `toStrudel` (no fidelity tax). Pure sub-functions operate
 * on already-collected `IREvent[]`; the async `analyzeSong` wrapper owns the
 * budgeted collection. Both the collector, the clock, and the yield primitive
 * are injectable so the slicing logic is deterministic under test.
 *
 * Attribution note: lanes key on `trackId ?? s ?? '$default'` — the SAME key
 * the timeline's `groupEventsByTrack` uses — so analysis lanes line up exactly
 * with rendered rows. `trackId`/`dollarPos` already carry IR-node provenance
 * (assigned by collect.ts), so this is reuse, not a parallel attribution path.
 *
 * Seek caveat (§7.4): a pattern with no exact repeat has no clean loop —
 * `detectPeriod` returns null and the horizon falls back to the analyzed cap.
 *
 * ⚠ THAT CLASS IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE RNG CASE THIS COMMENT USED TO NAME.
 * Since the cycle fingerprint reads the event's whole value partition (#1102),
 * any CONTINUOUSLY MODULATED control — `.cutoff(sine)`, a slow `gain` LFO —
 * makes every cycle genuinely differ, and such a LANE is aperiodic in the only
 * sense this module measures. Swept over 150 real tunes, that took documents
 * landing on the cap from 53 to 69 of the 142 that evaluate.
 *
 * A lane being aperiodic no longer makes the SONG aperiodic (#1104). Once the
 * progressive horizon is exhausted such lanes ABSTAIN and the span comes from
 * the lanes that do loop, which is #488's phasing rule applied to the case the
 * veto used to cover — see `detectDisplayPeriodAtCap`. That returned 20 of the
 * 69 to a real period, so the swept figure is now 49.
 *
 * Those 49 are aperiodic under every rule measured — 32 of them have a single
 * lane, so there is nothing to borrow a period from at all. What the display
 * should do with them is #1105, and it is a display question, not a reason to
 * ask a narrower question about identity here.
 *
 * A DETECTED PERIOD CAN ALSO BE TOO SHORT TO BE THIS SONG'S (#1107). It can be
 * true of everything the analysis has heard and still describe only part of the
 * document — accepted before a track entered, or accepted with a span that
 * excludes one — and either way the missing track draws as an empty, UNMARKED
 * row, indistinguishable from silence. `displayPeriodRule` adds the two
 * plausibility clauses that refuse those spans; swept, they move exactly the
 * seven defective documents and take the at-cap figure 49 → 56.

 * The span the view should show, together with WHAT IT MEANS — the analysis's

 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ONE VALUE AND NOT A NUMBER PLUS A BOOLEAN ───────────────────
 * `periodCycles` is a MEASUREMENT; a horizon is where the analysis STOPPED
 * LOOKING. They are different kinds of fact and they were previously told apart
 * by a sibling boolean that reached almost no consumer, so `periodCycles ??
 * horizonCycles` — the idiom that erases the difference — spread through the
 * view instead. Carrying the span and its meaning in one value makes the
 * distinction impossible to drop by accident: you cannot read `cycles` without
 * having `kind` in your hand.
 *
 * The three kinds are the three the view already distinguished by hand:
 *   `loop`    — a period was DETECTED. `cycles` is that period and the lanes
 *               span exactly one of them. This is the only cyclic kind: it is
 *               the only one where cycle `n + cycles` genuinely sounds like `n`.
 *   `capped`  — the horizon grew to its cap without confirming a period.
 *               `cycles` is where we gave up, not a property of the song.
 *   `horizon` — analysis ended before the cap with no period (collection was
 *               aborted, or there was nothing to analyze). `cycles` is what was
 *               actually looked at.
 *
 * ⚠ `capped` and `horizon` both mean "no period was found", and only `capped`
 * says the search was exhausted. They are kept apart because the view says
 * different things about them ("N+ cycles" vs "N cycles"), and collapsing them
 * would reintroduce exactly the erasure this type exists to prevent.

 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `detectDisplayPeriod` holds two rules that disagree. Its grounded one (#488,
 * from real DAW manuals) is that lanes of differing lengths PHASE — show the
 * max, never the lcm, because a 4-cycle track repeats happily inside a 5-cycle
 * view. Its other one is `if (p === null) return null`: a single lane with NO
 * loop discards every other lane's measured period and sends the whole document
 * to the 256-cycle cap. Measured over the corpus, that was 69 of 142 documents —
 * about half — drawn as a sliver on a timeline 256 cycles wide.
 *
 * If a 4-cycle lane can phase inside a 5-cycle view, so can a lane that never
 * repeats. A continuously modulated control (`.cutoff(sine)`) makes every cycle
 * genuinely differ, so "no loop" is the true answer about THAT LANE and not
 * about the song's structure.
 *
 * ── WHY ONLY AT THE CAP, which is the whole design ────────────────────────────
 * Below the cap a `null` from the period rule is not a defect — it is the signal
 * that DOUBLES the horizon, i.e. it is how a slow lane gets room to resolve.
 * Abstaining early answers with whatever short lane happens to have resolved and
 * the document never grows to where its real loop would have been found. Measured:
 * abstaining unconditionally sent 14 documents to period 1 — the single stretched
 * clip #1102 was filed for — and destroyed 5 correct periods (12→1, 10→1, 8→1,
 * 7→1, 6→1). So the rule is only ever asked once growth is exhausted. A derived
 * exclusion rule has to share the horizon of the detection it feeds.
 *
 * ── WHY A FLOOR ON THE PERIOD, and not on which lanes answered ───────────────
 * Even at the cap, an abstained max can be set by an ostinato while the content
 * abstains: six documents recovered to a 2-cycle span whose answering lanes were
 * the arpeggios and whose silent ones were the melody and bass. Three rules that
 * tested WHICH lanes answered were swept and all failed — requiring the densest
 * lane to answer, and requiring an event-share majority, each refused 15 sound
 * recoveries while still keeping 4 of the 6, because when the ostinato is the
 * denser lane no composition test can tell it from content. The floor below is
 * what works: the answer must itself be long enough to be a structural loop.
 *
 * Swept consequence: 20 documents leave the cap for a real period (6, 8, 14, 16,
 * 23, 24, 28, 32×4, 48×2, 64, 96×3); nothing changes below the cap, no period is
 * lost, and none collapse to 1. The remaining 49 are aperiodic by every reading
 * and belong to the display question, not to this rule.

 * ABSTAIN; below it the veto stands, because a `null` there is what buys the
 * next doubling. `detectDisplayPeriodAtCap`'s own header carries that argument.

 * ── THE PLAUSIBILITY CLAUSES (#1107) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * A detected period can be true of everything the analysis has HEARD and still
 * be false about the song, and both ways it fails leave a track drawing as an
 * empty, unmarked row — pixel-identical to a track that plays nothing, and
 * without even the fade a muted one gets.
 *
 * (a) UNHEARD TRACK — the analysis converged before a track entered. Measured on
 *     the corpus: `0/-Hx1rNCmeyD8` accepts period 1 at horizon 8 while its other
 *     six tracks first sound at cycles 16, 32, 56, 95, 128 and 159. Nothing here
 *     can detect that, because those events have not been collected — only the
 *     caller knows the document declares tracks it has not heard from, so it is
 *     asked (`hasUnheardTrack`). Gated to `horizon < cap` for the same reason
 *     abstention is gated to the cap: below it a `null` is the signal that grows
 *     the horizon, and at the cap there is nowhere left to grow, so an unheard
 *     track must not be able to block an answer forever. That bound is what
 *     makes the clause verdict-NEUTRAL for a track that is simply silent: six
 *     corpus documents register a pattern that never sounds in 256 cycles, and
 *     all six keep their exact period — they only take longer to reach it.
 *
 * (b) EXCLUDED LANE — the analysis heard the track and then accepted a span that
 *     excludes it. `250/19FzyPQc7bcR` accepts period 6 while `x4` first sounds at
 *     cycle 6 and `x5` at cycle 23, putting ~98.6% of the document's onsets and
 *     2 of its 5 tracks outside the view, on a document whose own `.mask()`s
 *     spell a 32–64-cycle arrangement.
 *
 * Swept per document, both clauses together move EXACTLY the seven defective
 * documents and nothing else — every one recovering its full lane set (1→7 ×3,
 * 2→4, 5→6, 3→5 ×2) — and aperiodic-at-cap goes 49 → 56 of 142. Three of those
 * are periods #1104 recovered; they are given back deliberately, because a span

   * answer it soundly.
   *
   * ── WHY THE CALLER OWNS IT, and it is not derived from `events` ─────────────
   * The question needs two sets in ONE key space: what the document declares,
   * and what has been heard. The events reaching `analyzeSong` are in the
   * DISPLAY lane space — production remaps every hap through `laneKeyForHap`
   * source containment (`MusicalTimeline.tsx`) so analysis lanes line up with
   * rendered rows ([[PV175]]) — and that space cannot answer it. Measured over
   * the corpus: 20 of the 78 documents with structural anchors have an anchor key
   * that NEVER receives an event in 256 cycles (a track whose haps carry no
   * `loc`, or whose `loc` precedes its own statement). There, "unheard" does not
   * mean a track that has yet to enter; it means a key nothing can ever land on,
   * so the clause would be waiting for something that does not exist.
   *
   * NOT a cost argument, which is worth saying because that was the first guess
   * and measurement refuted it: priced against its own control arm the structural
   * clause takes documents collected to the full cap from 71 to 85, +14, and the
   * capture-space clause costs +13 by construction (the 7 it moves, plus the 6
   * documents with a registered track that never sounds). The work is the same.
   * What differs is whether the question has an answer.
   *
   * In the CAPTURE key space the engine stamps — one key per registered pattern —
   * an unheard key can only mean a track that genuinely never sounds, which is 6
   * documents, and all 6 keep their exact period because the clause is bounded to
   * `horizon < cap`. Measured past the cap too: all 9 such tracks are silent
   * through 1024 cycles, so none is a late entry the bound hides.
   *
   * So the caller reads the raw capture keys BEFORE its own remap and compares
   * them against the engine's registered set. Absent, the clause is inert and
   * the rule is exactly the #1104 one — a deliberate default, since a caller
   * that cannot name the document's tracks has nothing to claim about them.

 * view's span underneath the user as they page and make the density heatmap's
 * scale incomparable between windows.
