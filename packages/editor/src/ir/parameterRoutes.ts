 * from a short, known set of calls: `Stack` from `stack`, `layer`, `jux` and `off`;
 * `When` from `mask`; `Degrade` from `degrade` and `degradeBy`; `Every` from

 * as a `Late` inside the stack, where the walk sees it. A per-method list was
 * written first and break-tested: opening any tag to every method turned nothing
 * red, because no parsed document can reach a method the list left out. So a NEW
 * producer of one of these tags has to be measured before it is trusted here — a
 * call that moved time without putting a node in the tree would pass silently.
 *
 * ⚠ A METHOD THAT TAKES A FUNCTION (`every`, `sometimesBy`, `layer`, `jux`) IS SAFE
 * ONLY BECAUSE THE FUNCTION'S BODY IS IN THE TREE. `jux(x => x.fast(2))` reaches the
 * parameter a second time through a `Fast`, and the two routes play it at once, so
 * it declines (`routesAreDisjoint`). A function the parser cannot model is an

 * the last call in a chain wins: `.gain("<0.2 0.8>").gain(0.5)` plays 0.5 on every
 * event (measured). In the IR the later call is the OUTER node, so a parameter is
 * dead exactly when a same-key `Param` encloses it. That holds through structure
 * too — `stack(a.gain("<…>"), b).gain(0.5)` overrides the inner steps (measured,
 * engine test). Drawing them would show values nobody hears, and editing them would
 * change nothing, silently. Keys are canonical, so `.cutoff` over `.lpf` counts too.
 *
 * Every descendant of a Param inherits its key, not only its `body`. Only a
 * Param's VALUE could hold a Param the other way, and no document spells a
 * same-key control inside another control's argument — a distinction no input can
 * exercise is a branch no test can defend, so it is not drawn.
