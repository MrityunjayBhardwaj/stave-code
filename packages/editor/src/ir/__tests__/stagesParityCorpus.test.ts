/**
 * stagesParityCorpus — THE PINNED BASELINE for staged-pipeline parity with
 * `parseStrudel`, per document, over the 150 real tunes (#1375).
 *
 * ── THE CONTRACT, AND WHY IT NEEDED A WIDER GATE ─────────────────────────────
 * `parseStrudelStages.ts:6` states it plainly:
 *
 *   "End-to-end behavior at FINAL is byte-identical to parseStrudel(code)."
 *
 * The D-06 sentinel in `parseStrudelStages.test.ts` asserts exactly that — over
 * 13 hand-written fixtures. Of those 13, **0 contain a `const` or `let`** and
 * **0 contain `arrange(` / `cat(` / `slowcat(`**.
 *
 * ── THREE NUMBERS, AND WHY THE ISSUE'S 17 IS THE SMALLEST ────────────────────
 * Measured over the 150-tune corpus, "diverges" has three defensible readings.
 * They were 44 / 26 / 17 when first pinned, a 2.6× spread over one corpus:
 *
 *    5  deep equality      — the stated contract, and what D-06 asserts
 *    3  full shape tree    — the two sides disagree on structure anywhere
 *    3  top-level tag only — they disagree at the FIRST node inside Track
 *
 * Three fixes since, each scored against the class it claimed:
 *   #1376  ported the multi-statement track split to RAW  → 44 → 39, B 8 → 3
 *   #1375  resolved top-level bindings at MINI-EXPANDED   → 39 → 20, A 18 → 9,
 *          C 16 → 6, and B UNCHANGED at 3 exactly as predicted
 *   #1383  discriminated a structured `Code` wrapper from  → 20 → 5, A 9 → 0
 *          the parse's give-up fallback                        C 6 → 0
 *
 * #1375's body quotes 17, measured before #1376 landed. That reading is the
 * weakest of the three: it counts a
 * document only when the very top node changed, so a document whose structure
 * is wrong three levels down does not appear in it at all. The contract the file
 * actually states is byte-identity, and by that measure **5 of 150 (3%)**
 * diverge. All three are pinned below so no fix can improve one while quietly
 * worsening another.
 *
 * A gate is only as wide as its fixture list. This is the third bug of the class
 * — #113 (a prelude lifted as opaque Code → empty timeline), #671 (labelled
 * tracks losing their labels), #1373 (`arrange()` behind consts → a 3:28 song
 * bounced at 0:08) — each found through a downstream consumer degrading quietly,
 * each closed by adding one more fixture. This file replaces that loop with a
 * number that cannot drift unnoticed.
 *
 * ── WHY A PER-DOCUMENT PIN, AND NOT JUST THE COUNTS ──────────────────────────
 * A count is the wrong instrument: fixing three binding cases while breaking
 * three others reports 17 and looks like a no-op. Two entirely different sets of
 * documents produce the same headline. Every document's verdict is therefore
 * pinned individually, and the failure message IS the enumeration — which
 * documents moved, and which direction.
 *
 * The 150 rows are pinned INCLUDING the matching ones, deliberately. If only
 * divergences were pinned, a document dropping out of the sweep entirely would
 * shrink the denominator in silence and read as progress.
 *
 * A parse that THROWS is recorded as a divergence carrying its error, never
 * skipped, for the same reason.
 *
 * ── WHAT THEY ARE, as of this pin ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The mechanisms are classified per document (see `classifyDivergence`). The
 * `A-opaque-collapse` and `C-via-vs-blob` classes are now EMPTY: measuring all
 * 20 residual documents showed those two were never two mechanisms. Both were
 * `parseRootWithChainMeta` discarding a `Code` node that carried a structured
 * `via`, and the classifier split them only by whether the difference surfaced
 * first as a changed tag (A) or a changed field (C). One predicate emptied
 * both — 15 documents, no regressions (#1383).
 *
 * ⚠ That is worth remembering when reading the classes below: a class boundary
 * can itself carry an unverified claim about mechanism. The counts here are
 * measured; the names are a hypothesis about what groups them.
 *
 * ⚠ The 3 remaining `B-track-count` documents are NOT a bug to be fixed by
 * making the staged path match `parseStrudel`. They are #950's deliberate
 * behaviour: a top-level comma expands to separate Track lanes in the staged
 * path so the timeline can anchor marks per arm, while `parseStrudel` keeps one
 * Track containing a Stack. For those documents the contract at
 * `parseStrudelStages.ts:6` is false BY DESIGN, and reconciling it is a
 * decision about #950, not a defect to patch here.
 *
 * ⚠ The `Stack→Seq` and `Param→Stack` rows deserve more alarm than the
 * `→Code` ones. An opaque blob is visibly nothing and fails loudly downstream;
 * a DIFFERENT structure looks right and is consumed as though it were correct.
 *
 * ── HOW TO RE-BASELINE, deliberately awkward ─────────────────────────────────
 *   UPDATE_STAGES_PARITY_BASELINE=1 pnpm --filter @stave/editor exec vitest run \
 *     src/ir/__tests__/stagesParityCorpus.test.ts
 * Then READ THE DIFF and enumerate the movers in the PR. The whole point of this
 * file is that the number moves for a stated reason; re-baselining without
 * reading the diff restores the blindness it was written to remove.
