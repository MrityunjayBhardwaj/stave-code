/**
 * A `$:`-declared track resolves the document's bindings (#1392).
 *
 * ── WHY THESE ARMS ARE ABSOLUTE, NEVER DIFFERENTIAL ─────────────────────────
 * This defect survived a corpus gate that compares `parseStrudel` against the
 * staged pipeline, because BOTH left every reference opaque. The two agreed,
 * and agreement is all a differential gate can see. So every arm below asserts
 * what the tree must actually CONTAIN — no `Code` nodes, the sample really
 * reached — rather than that two producers match each other.
 *
 * ── WHAT WAS BROKEN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * What an identifier means is a property of the DOCUMENT, but binding
 * resolution was a property of one branch of the track dispatch. `parseStrudel`
 * ran `buildBindingMap` only when the source had no `$:` at all; both `$:`
 * branches passed `undefined`, and the staged pipeline mirrored that gate on
 * purpose to preserve parity. `$:` is the ordinary way to declare a track, so
 * the ordinary document lost its bindings — and downstream that is not cosmetic:
 * an opaque arm yields no leaves, so no `armIndex`, so the timeline drew NO
 * CLIPS at all for an arranged song.
 *
 * Measured on `76e42d9e`, opaque `Code` nodes left in the tree:
 *
 *   arrange([4, a], [8, b])      0     $: arrange([4, a], [8, b])     2
 *   stack(a, b)                  0     $: stack(a, b)                 2
 *                                      $: a                           1
 *                                      drums: stack(a, b)             2
