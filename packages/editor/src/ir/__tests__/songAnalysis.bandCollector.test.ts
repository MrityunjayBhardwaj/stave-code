/**
 * #1197 — the song collector's BAND vs PREFIX shapes.
 *
 * `analyzeSong`'s collector interface is band-limited, but until the engine
 * gained `getTimelineEventsBand` the app could only ask for `[0, endCycle)` and
 * filter down to the band. These arms pin the two properties that make the swap
 * a fix rather than a rewrite:
 *
 *   VERDICT (the control arm) — both collectors produce an IDENTICAL analysis.
 *     Without this the cost figure below would be comparing two different
 *     analyses, and a cheaper wrong answer is not an improvement.
 *   COST — the prefix shape queries dramatically more cycles for that same
 *     answer, and the band shape queries each cycle exactly once.
 *
 * Both arms drive the REAL `analyzeSong` loop rather than re-deriving its
 * hint/doubling/cap schedule here — a second copy of that schedule would agree
 * with itself while diverging from the code under test.
