/**
 * controlClassificationGuards.test.ts — the control-classification behaviours
 * that NO metric can see.
 *
 * The FX→Param collapse moves ~54 corpus nodes off the `FX` tag. Tag counts and
 * parity snapshots will move loudly and review well. This file exists for the
 * behaviours that sit in the blind spots BEHIND those counts — where a
 * regression produces no count movement, no snapshot churn, no thrown error,
 * and no failing gate.
 *
 * Three independent reasons a blind spot exists here:
 *
 *   1. ZERO CORPUS OCCURRENCES. `reverb` and `hpf` appear nowhere in the 57
 *      corpus files, so no count can ever observe them regressing.
 *   2. THE METRIC IS THE WRONG SHAPE. `extractTransform` emits a transform
 *      arrow; a change there alters the emitted STRING while leaving every tag
 *      count identical. Counting nodes cannot see a change in how a node is
 *      spelled.
 *   3. SEMANTICS DO NOT MOVE EITHER. The two arrow forms are hap-equivalent
 *      (pinned below with the eval oracle), so even a behavioural test would
 *      stay green. Only the emitted string shows a change.
 *
 * So the assertions here are deliberately on the EMITTED STRING and the
 * CLASSIFIED PARAM NODE (its canonical key/value on the IR), not on tags. Each pin says whether the collapse is
 * expected to PRESERVE it or deliberately FLIP it — a pin whose intent is
 * unstated is just a tripwire, and the next person deletes it.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * SCOPE — what these pins are, and what they are NOT
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Read before treating a failure here as a user-facing bug. It is not one.
 * Both surfaces this file pins are INTERNAL:
 *
 *   - `toStrudel` has ZERO production callers. The two modules that could call
 *     it document that they deliberately do not (`visualEdit/writeback.ts:11`,
 *     `visualEdit/arrange/serialize.ts:7`): write-back does span surgery on
 *     TEXT precisely to avoid this whole-statement regenerator, and
 *     `dist/index.d.ts:156` states the reason outright — "NEVER calls
 *     `toStrudel` (no fidelity tax)". So neither arrow spelling ever reaches a
 *     user's document. `toStrudel` IS the oracle for several test suites, and
 *     that is the reason to pin it.
 *   - The split param keys (`params.lpf` vs `params.cutoff`) are read in
 *     production by NOTHING except the IR Inspector's `Object.keys()` debug
 *     views (`IRInspectorPanel.tsx:469`, `IRInspectorChrome.ts:29`). Pitch
 *     resolution reads only `note`/`n`/`freq` (`musicalTimeline/pitch.ts`).
 *     Audio gets its `room`/`cutoff`/`delay` from Strudel's own eval, never
 *     from our IR.
 *
 * The collapse these pins guard is therefore INTERNAL COHERENCE and drift
 * removal — retiring the last hand-maintained mirror of Strudel's control
 * vocabulary — not a fix for anything a user can currently observe. That is a
 * good reason to do it, and a bad reason to rush it ahead of defects that ARE
 * user-visible. Stating the scope here so the next reader prices it correctly
 * rather than inferring urgency from the density of assertions.
 *
 * Everything asserted here was verified against unmodified `f6c5049f` before
 * being written down. Nothing here is transcribed from a design document.
 *
 * See #955 (this suite) · #944 (the collapse) · #929 (adapter consolidation).
