/**
 * euclidAuthority.test.ts — the IR must draw the euclid rhythm Strudel PLAYS.
 *
 * The oracle here is `@strudel/mini`'s own evaluator, queried for real haps —
 * not a table of rhythms I typed in. That matters: the bug this file pins
 * (#907) existed *because* someone wrote down what they believed the rhythm
 * was. A test asserting `bd(5,8) === '10101011'` would have passed against the
 * broken code forever, since it encodes the same belief. Asking Strudel what
 * it actually triggers is the only check that can disagree with us.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG (#907), and why it lived three months:
 *   - `parseMini`'s hand-rolled `bjorklund` disagreed with Strudel's on 44 of
 *     152 (k,n) pairs to n=16 — `bd(5,8)` plays 10110110, the IR drew 10101011.
 *   - Its rotation ran the wrong way: Strudel's `_euclidRot` does
 *     `rotate(b, -rotation)` (a RIGHT rotation); we left-rotated.
 * Both defaults are correct — `bd(3,8)` is one of the pairs the copy got right,
 * and `rot=0` is a no-op in either direction. The canonical example works, the
 * docs example works, so every hand-check passed while the timeline drew a
 * rhythm the audio never played. Nothing threw. The two representations were
 * simply never compared, which is what this file now does on every run.
