/**
 * #1387 — the record the Inspector's views are built from, over every document
 * in the archive.
 *
 * This replaces the staged-pipeline parity baseline (#1375). That gate compared
 * two parsers; there is one now, so what can go wrong is the recording itself:
 *
 *   1. recording changes the parse          → `ir` differs from `parseStrudel`
 *   2. a body with no track, or a track
 *      with no body                         → the counts differ
 *   3. a RAW body that is not the source
 *      it claims to be                      → the slice differs from its text
 *
 * Each is reported per document by name, so a red run is the list to read.
