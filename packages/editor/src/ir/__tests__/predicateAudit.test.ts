/**
 * predicateAudit.test.ts — the census in `ir/PREDICATE-AUDIT.md` still matches
 * the source (#959).
 *
 * `parseStrudel.ts` decides things about JavaScript syntax and about Strudel's
 * vocabulary by hand, in anchored regular expressions. Every other module in
 * the parse path asks an authority instead and has zero. The audit document
 * lists all 42 regex literals in the file — the 35 anchored predicates grouped by
 * the question each decides and who owns the answer, plus the 7 unanchored — so that
 * "find the next parser bug" is a finite list rather than a search.
 *
 * A document like that decays the moment someone adds a regex, and a decayed
 * census reads exactly like a current one. Hence this gate: it re-derives the
 * census from the source on every run and fails if the document disagrees.
 * Adding a predicate is still allowed; adding one *silently* is not.
 *
 * WHY IT ASKS TYPESCRIPT. Finding regex literals in a TypeScript file means
 * knowing which slashes are division, which are inside strings, and which are
 * inside comments — the same class of question the audit is about. Answering
 * it with a scanner here would reproduce the defect inside the tool that
 * measures it, so the scan delegates to `ts.createSourceFile`. That also makes
 * the exclusion of commented-out regexes structural rather than heuristic:
 * four of them are quoted in prose in `parseStrudel.ts` and the tokenizer
 * never offers them.
