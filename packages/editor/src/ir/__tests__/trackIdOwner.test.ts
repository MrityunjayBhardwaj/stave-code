/**
 * One owner for what a mute marker is (#1679) — a census of the SOURCE, not of
 * behaviour. Modelled on `knobScaleOwner.test.ts` (#1581).
 *
 * Strudel mutes a track whose label starts OR ends with `_`. Before #1679 that
 * one fact was read in seven places: the engine's capture hook knew both sides,
 * and six others knew only the prefix, so a silent `drums_:` was named `drums_`
 * and shown unmuted, and two `$_:` lines shared one id. `splitMuteMarker` in
 * `trackId.ts` is now the reading; everything else calls it.
 *
 * ⚠ NO BEHAVIOURAL TEST CAN SEE A SECOND READING THAT AGREES. A new
 * `label.startsWith('_')` somewhere is green on every arm until the day the
 * marker's spelling changes again — which is exactly how #1679 happened. So this
 * file reads text.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SHAPE `startsWith('_')` HAS HONEST OTHER USES. Sound maps hide
 * internal entries behind a leading `_`, and the inline-viz method family is
 * spelled `_pianoroll`. Those are different facts that share a character. They
 * are listed below BY FILE AND BY COUNT, each with its reason: a new use in one
 * of those files still changes a count and fails here, so the list is not a
 * place for a second reading to hide.
