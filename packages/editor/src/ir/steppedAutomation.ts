/**
 * Stepped automation a track declares, read off the static IR (#1463 Stage 1).
 *
 * `.gain("<0.2 0.8>")` is a parameter that holds one value per cycle and moves
 * between them — the stepped class, next to #1464's continuous one. It already
 * parses completely: `Param{value: Cycle{items: [Play "0.2", Play "0.8"]}}`, with
 * an exact source span on every step. This module turns that into what a lane
 * needs to DRAW it, and into the one edit a lane may make to it.
 *
 * WHAT THE ENGINE DOES WITH IT, measured through the real evaluator before any of
 * this was written (#1463, the grounding comment on the issue):
 *
 *   `<a b>`        cycle n plays step (n mod 2)          → period 2
 *   `<a@2 b>`      a weighted step spans 2 cycles         → period 3
 *   `<a b>/2`      every step spans 2 cycles              → period 4   (#1579)
 *   `<a b>/1.5`    a step changes INSIDE a cycle          → not stepped
 *   `<a [b c]>`    the second step SUBDIVIDES its cycle   → not stepped
 *   `<a ~ b>`      the `~` step SILENCES THE TRACK        → not "no value"
 *
 * ⚠ A STEP IS ADDRESSED BY ITS INDEX, NOT BY A BAR. Step k plays in every cycle
 * where `cycle mod period` selects it, so an edit to step k changes every bar that
 * plays it — which is what the document says. A lane that pretended to change one
 * bar would be describing a document nobody wrote.
 *
 * ⚠ `cycle mod period` HOLDS ONLY WHERE NOTHING ABOVE THE PARAMETER MOVES TIME
 * (#1584). `.slow(2)`, `.early(1)` and `jux(x => x.fast(2))` hand the parameter a
 * cycle no lane can draw, so the walk admits a parameter only under nodes measured
 * to leave the cycle alone.
 *
 * ⚠ AN ARRANGEMENT SECTION IS THE ONE TIME CHANGE A LANE CAN DRAW (#1585). An arm
 * of `arrange`, `cat` or `slowcat` hands the parameter how many cycles THAT SECTION
 * has played, so the walk records the section instead of declining, and
 * `stepIndexAtCycle` does the section's arithmetic. This was once recorded as "an
 * arrange arm follows the absolute cycle", from `arrange([1, a], [2, b])`: a
 * section two cycles behind per pass, which a two-step pattern cannot tell apart.
 * `[3, a], [1, b]` can. And a section that appears twice does NOT continue its
 * count — each appearance is its own arm, and both play the same steps in a pass
 * (engine test, on a three-step pattern where the two readings disagree).
 *
 * Mirrors `signalAutomation.ts`: pure, no eval, the same per-track attribution,
 * and the same direction of error — ABSTAIN rather than approximate. A missing
 * lane shows less than it could; a wrong one is the editor lying about what
 * plays. The walk over the track is structural, over the IR; a literal's STEPS are
 * read off krill's parse of that literal, the parse the engine itself runs, because
 * the IR's lowering flattens what decides them (#1587, `stepsOfLiteral`).

/**
 * The steps of one literal, read off KRILL's tree — the parse the engine runs on

 *
 * ⚠ NOT OFF THE IR (#1587). `parseStrudel` lowers krill's tree into PatternIR, and
 * the lowering flattens exactly what decides whether a literal holds one value per
 * cycle. Each of these came out as a `Cycle` of numeric Plays, and each plays
 * something else (engine test): `[1|1.5]` is a RANDOM pick, `<1 2, 3 4>` is two
 * layers, `<0.2 0.8:1>` plays the array `[0.8, 1]`. `<0.3!3 0.8>` became three
 * Plays on ONE span, so an edit to one of them moved all three copies' bars. The IR
 * also kept one `/2` of `/2/2` (which plays `/4`) and dropped `/0` entirely.
 * krill names every one of these. A check of the text between the IR's spans was
 * drafted first and set aside: it would have been a second copy of the grammar.
 *
 * The accepted shape, dumped from `@strudel/mini@1.2.6` rather than read off the
 * grammar:
 *
 *   fastcat ── ONE element: weight 1, reps 1, and no op but one `/n` (`slowFactor`)
 *    └ polymeter_slowcat ── ONE child (a second one is a `,` layer)
 *       └ fastcat ── one element per STEP: an atom whose token is a number
 *
 * A step holds `weight` cycles — krill folds `@n`, `_` and `!n` into that one
 * field, and the engine follows it: `<0.2!3@2 0.8>` has weight 4 and plays 0.2 for
 * four cycles (measured). Its only op may be `replicate`; anything else rides on the
 * step (`:` tail, `?` degrade, `(3,8)`, a per-step `*`) and changes what it plays.
 * `!n` is therefore ONE step — the one number the user wrote — and an edit to it
 * moves every cycle it holds.
