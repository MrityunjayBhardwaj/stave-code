/**
 * How long is the document — structurally, off the IR, with no evaluation and
 * no window.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `SongAnalysis.displaySpan`. That span answers "what should the
 * timeline SHOW", and it is measured over the evaluated event stream against a
 * progressive horizon. Three shapes make it wrong for a bounce, all measured
 * (#1359): a period-4 loop with 400 cycles of content reports `{loop, 4}`; an
 * aperiodic 400-cycle document reports `{capped, 256}` and truncates 144 cycles;
 * and — the one that surprises — an aperiodic document only 40 cycles long ALSO
 * reports `{capped, 256}`, because a song that ends still grows to the cap. A
 * bounce driven off it renders six times more silence than music.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT `SceneClip.endCycle` EITHER. Those cycles are song-absolute, but
 * the LAST clip of every lane is flushed at `originCycle + nCycles`
 * unconditionally, so `max(endCycle)` hands the visible window straight back.
 *
 * THE DATUM IS `ArrangeArm.weight`, which `PatternIR` already states outright:
 * "the whole node's period is `Σ weight`". This module is the one place that
 * reads it AS AN EXTENT. The three existing `Σ weight` reduces in
 * `structuralWalk.ts` are deliberately left alone — they compute a period in
 * order to modulo into it and SELECT an arm, which is a different job.
 *
 * THE ANSWER IS TYPED, NOT A NUMBER, for the same reason `DisplaySpan` refuses to
 * collapse `capped` into `horizon`: the cases mean different things and a bare
 * number erases which one answered. A caller that gets `0` cannot tell "this
 * document ends immediately" from "this document never ends".

/**
 * The document's extent.
 *
 * WALK RULES, and each is load-bearing:
 *
 * - `Arrange` → `Σ weight`, and **the arms are not descended into**. An arm
 *   spans `n` WHOLE cycles at the pattern's natural rate, so a longer inner
 *   arrangement is TRUNCATED by its arm, not extended by it. Taking a max that
 *   descended would over-report exactly the documents most likely to be nested.
 * - `Stack` → the MAX over tracks, never the sum. Tracks are parallel.
 * - `Track` / `Loop` → transparent.
 * - `Fast` / `Slow` → scale what is below them.
 * - `Code` → TAINT. A `Code` node is either an opaque wrapper around a
 *   `.method(args)` Stave could not parse (with the real receiver at
 *   `via.inner`) or a whole parse failure. Either way an unknown transform sits
 *   between the arrangement and the output, and it may be a time-scaling one —
 *   measured on the real corpus, 3 of the 5 arranged documents have a `Code` on
 *   the path, and one of those three also has a `Slow`. So the receiver is still
 *   walked (to learn WHETHER an arrangement exists) but any arrangement found
 *   under it is reported as `opaque` rather than measured.
 *
 * ⚠ TAINT IS DOCUMENT-WIDE ONCE ANY ARRANGEMENT IS TAINTED, deliberately. The
 * result is a MAX, so one unmeasurable arm invalidates the maximum — the
 * untrusted arrangement could be the longest. Being wrong towards `opaque` costs
 * nothing (the UI treats `opaque` and `loop` alike, asking for a length); being
 * wrong towards `arranged` silently truncates someone's bounce.
