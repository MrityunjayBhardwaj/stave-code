/**
 * structuralWalk — the "keep" half of the collect.ts split (#945).
 *
 * `collect.ts` conflates two jobs: deriving lane STRUCTURE from source spans, and computing
 * BEHAVIOUR (onsets) by re-implementing Strudel's RNG / euclid / weighting. The split moves
 * behaviour to Strudel's own `queryArc` and keeps structure here — because the lane anchors
 * (`dollarPos` / `leafIndex` / `armIndex`) are sourced from source-span structure, which haps
 * do not carry, so haps must JOIN to a structural walk rather than replace it. See
 * `COLLECT-SPLIT-AUDIT.md` for the consumer map and `collect.ts:486/651/745` for where the
 * anchors are set today.
 *
 * This walk owns two properties the hap stream cannot give:
 *   1. the anchors above (lane / voice-row / clip identity from source position); and
 *   2. per-node resilience — a syntactically-valid but semantically-invalid sub-node (an
 *      unresolved binding, a mid-edit) degrades only its own lane, where `evaluate` throws and
 *      blanks everything. The timeline's lane skeleton must survive mid-edit code.
 *
 * Phase 1 (#973) IMPLEMENTS the seam by mirroring collect's ANCHOR threading (Track → dollarPos
 * outer-wins + leafIndex reset; voice-Stack → sequential leafIndex; Arrange/Cycle → per-cycle
 * arm selection) and its `withWrapperLoc` loc-layering, while DROPPING the behaviour (timing,
 * window-clip, RNG, euclid). It emits one structural item per leaf reached, then aggregates to
 * per-lane skeletons with the SAME first-wins rules `timelineMarks.ts` applies to collect's
 * events — so `aggregateLaneItems` is shared with the gate's oracle and the two cannot drift.
 *
 * A structural walk reaches leaves collect's onset/window logic would drop, so structuralWalk
 * may report ADDITIONAL lanes (the resilience it adds). For every lane collect DOES produce,
 * the anchors match byte-for-byte — proven over the corpus by `structuralWalk.test.ts`.

 * It is the MINIMUM start and MAXIMUM end over the arm's whole subtree, not the
 * top node's own `loc` — two shapes make the top node the wrong answer:
 *
 *   - a combinator's `loc` covers its OPERATOR, not its content: `bd*2` gives
 *     `Fast` at [8,10] while the `bd` it plays is at [6,8]. Anchoring on 8 puts
 *     the anchor AFTER the haps it must catch, so they fall through to the
 *     previous arm — the very fold this fixes.
 *   - a multi-element arm has no `loc` at all: `~ sd` is a `Seq` with
 *     `loc: undefined` over located children.
 *
 * Taking the extremes of the subtree is the same reasoning `timelineMarks.ts`
 * already applies when it picks the minimum start for the outer combinator.
 * Returns `undefined` when nothing in the subtree is located, so a genuinely
 * unlocated arm stays unanchored rather than claiming a wrong span.

/**
 * The arms of a SINGLE-TRACK document's root comma stack, each with the lane
 * identity it owns (#1553).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS, AND WHY IT IS HERE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `$: s("bd, cp")` is one track whose pattern happens to be a stack, and the
 * timeline draws one lane per arm. That used to be arranged by the PARSER: the
 * staged pipeline fabricated a top-level `Track` wrapper per arm, so `laneKeyOf`
 * and `declaredTrackAnchors` both saw N tracks and needed no special case.
 *
 * It cost the chain. Once arms are wrappers there is nowhere to put the thing
 * WRAPPING them, so `.gain()`/`.sound()`/`.room()` applied to the whole stack
 * were dropped outright (#1553). The split was a presentation concern reshaping
 * the parse tree, and the parse tree is not presentation's to reshape —
 * structure is what the source says, lanes are what the view decides.
 *
 * So the parse now states the truth (`Track[Param:gain[Stack[bd, cp]]]`,
 * byte-identical to `parseStrudel`) and the per-arm view lives here, in the
 * layer that derives lanes. ⚠ ONE DEFINITION, TWO READERS: the structural walk
 * below keys its lane items from this, and `timelineMarks.declaredTrackAnchors`
 * keys the eval-side containment anchors from it. A second copy of "which
 * stack is the root one" would let the skeleton and the marks disagree about
 * what a lane IS, which is the exact failure #950 was filed for.
 *
 * ── SCOPE, DELIBERATELY NARROW ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Only a document whose ROOT is one `Track`. A multi-statement document's
 * tracks already own `d1…dN`, so splitting a comma inside one of them would
 * mint a colliding id — and the parser's version never did it either (it split
 * only the top-level stack), so this is the previous reach exactly, not a
 * widening. Reached through chain wrappers only (`Param`, structured `Code`):
 * anything else between the track and a stack means the stack is not the
 * track's root, and a stack nested inside a combinator arm must not be split.
