 *
 * This was a hand-rolled transcription in `parseMini` until #907, and it was
 * WRONG: it disagreed with the original on 44 of 152 (k,n) pairs to n=16, so
 * the timeline drew a rhythm the audio never played. It survived three months
 * because `bd(3,8)` — the canonical example — is one of the cases it got right.
 *
 * The two euclid helpers (this one and `visualEdit/notation/parse.ts`) were
 * duplicated until #943 unified them here — the IR grammar and the notation
 * grid/roll now share ONE distribution authority. The notation copy's guard
 * that shadowed inversion (#917) is the reason a single home matters: a copy —
 * or a guard over a copy — is correct the day it is written and free to drift.
