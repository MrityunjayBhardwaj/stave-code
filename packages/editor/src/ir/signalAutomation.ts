/**
 * Continuous automation a track declares, read off the static IR (#1464 Stage 1).
 *
 * `.cutoff(saw.slow(4).range(200, 2000))` is a parameter that MOVES, and until
 * #1478/#1482 it reached the IR as an opaque `Code` — the timeline could not see
 * that anything was modulated at all. Those two landed the three legs #1464 names
 * as its prerequisite, so the shape, the rate and the range are now plain field
 * reads off a nested node:
 *
 *   Param{key:'cutoff', value: Range{lo:200, hi:2000,

 *
 * This module turns that into what a lane needs to DRAW one, plus — since Stage 2
 * (#1464 option 2) — WHERE each leg is written, so a control can edit it in place.
 * It still emits no source and holds no inverse: `SignalSpans` carries source
 * COORDINATES, and the byte-verbatim round-trip #1482 established stays preserved
 * by construction here, because nothing in this file can produce text. What
 * changes is that a caller now has somewhere precise to write, which is exactly
 * the leverage Stage 2 needs and the whole of what this file lends it.
 *
 * Mirrors `trackOrder.ts`: pure and structural, no eval and no source scanning,
 * producing an IR-derived input for `buildTimelineScene` (which is documented
 * PURE — no IR walk) rather than reaching into the IR from inside the scene.

 * `{note, freq, s, gain, velocity, color} ∪ params`), and a key is how a
 * dimension is named there. `cutoff`/`resonance`/`pan`/`room` arrive via
 * `params`; `gain` has a dedicated slot. Both are addressed by key.
 *
 * Structural and horizon-FREE, which is the property that matters. An earlier
 * attempt at this exclusion derived it by watching a probe window, so a field
 * whose period exceeded that window read as unstable and got dropped — it
 * discarded `note` and `s` in ~75 documents. `Param{value: …Signal}` is the same
 * fact at horizon 4 and at horizon 256, so it cannot drift with the horizon it
 * feeds.

/**
 * Signals whose output actually REPEATS, listed rather than derived (#1465).

 * The song period rule folds a signal's rate into the song's period, and that is
 * only meaningful for a signal that comes back to where it started. `sine.slow(4)`
 * repeats every 4 cycles; `rand` and `perlin` sample new values forever, `time`
 * grows without bound, and `mouseX` is live input. Sampling any of those longer
 * never yields a repeat, so there is no rate to fold — a document automated only
 * by those has no true period at all, and the analysis must say so rather than
 * invent one.
 *
 * ⚠ AN ALLOWLIST, DELIBERATELY, and the direction of the default is the reason.
 * A kind added to `PatternIR` later and forgotten here is treated as NOT
 * periodic, which costs a fold the analysis could have made — the period stays
 * the structural one, which is the answer production already gives. The denylist
 * spelling fails the other way: a new noise source would be folded as though it
 * repeated, and the song would be handed a definite length its audio does not
 * have. One direction under-promises, the other lies.
 *
 * The membership is `@strudel/core@1.2.6/signal.mjs` read directly, the same
 * source `polarityOf` above is grounded in: the periodic set is the waveform
 * family (`sine`/`cosine`/`saw`/`isaw`/`tri`/`itri`/`square`) in both its
 * unipolar and `2`-suffixed bipolar spellings, and nothing else.

 *    repeats and nothing from noise (`signalDimensionsOf`): `sine.slow(4)` folds `[4]`,
 *    `perlin.slow(4)` folds `[]`. A swap between the two can change how long the song
