 * Continuous automation a track declares, read off the static IR (#1464 Stage 1).

 * `.cutoff(saw.slow(4).range(200, 2000))` is a parameter that MOVES, and until
 * #1478/#1482 it reached the IR as an opaque `Code` — the timeline could not see
 * that anything was modulated at all. Those two landed the three legs #1464 names
 * as its prerequisite, so the shape, the rate and the range are now plain field
 * reads off a nested node:
 *
 *   Param{key:'cutoff', value: Range{lo:200, hi:2000,

 *
 * This module turns that into what a lane needs to DRAW one, plus — since Stage 2
 * (#1464 option 2) — WHERE each leg is written, so a control can edit it in place.
 * It still emits no source and holds no inverse: `SignalSpans` carries source
 * COORDINATES, and the byte-verbatim round-trip #1482 established stays preserved
 * by construction here, because nothing in this file can produce text. What
 * changes is that a caller now has somewhere precise to write, which is exactly
 * the leverage Stage 2 needs and the whole of what this file lends it.
 *
 * Mirrors `trackOrder.ts`: pure and structural, no eval and no source scanning,
 * producing an IR-derived input for `buildTimelineScene` (which is documented
 * PURE — no IR walk) rather than reaching into the IR from inside the scene.
