/**
 * A probe must not be collected as a gate — the editor half (#1113).
 *
 * The app package has had this since #1111, enforced there by a directory scan.
 * The mechanism cannot be shared, because the two packages collect differently:
 *
 *   packages/app     `include` matches only `*.test.ts`, so `_name.spec.ts` is
 *                    inert by extension. 19 probes rely on that, and the app-side
 *                    guard's job is to catch a probe misnamed `_name.test.ts`.
 *   packages/editor  no `include` at all, so vitest's default collects BOTH
 *                    `*.test.ts` and `*.spec.ts`. Renaming a probe changes nothing
 *                    here, so the convention is enforced by an `exclude` instead.
 *
 * What its absence cost: `_coverageDecomp.analysis.test.ts` states in its own header
 * that "Console output is the deliverable; the assertion is trivial so the run always
 * passes". It has one assertion, and it was contributing a meaningless green plus a
 * console dump to the editor gate.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THIS ASKS VITEST INSTEAD OF READING THE CONFIG. Asserting that the exclude
 * ARRAY contains a pattern proves only that a string is present — not that the string
 * matches the files it is meant to, and not that vitest applies it. Both of those are
 * the actual property. So each arm filters a real run to one path and reads whether
 * anything was collected. It costs a couple of seconds and cannot pass on a pattern
 * that silently matches nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ AND WHY IT DOES NOT USE `vitest list`: that subcommand does not exist in 1.6.1
 * (run | related | watch | dev | bench | typecheck), so it is parsed as a filename
 * filter and drops into WATCH MODE, hanging until killed. See #1195.
