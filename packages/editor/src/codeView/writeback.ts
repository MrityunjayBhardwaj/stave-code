/**
 * writeback — chunk → document.
 *
 * The mutation half of the visual-editing spine. Visual panels read a
 * `ChunkInfo` (see `chunkDetect.ts`) to learn the doc offsets they may edit,
 * then route every edit through here so it is:
 *
 *  1. **Surgical** — only the named offset range changes; the rest of the
 *     statement (mini-notation quotes, spacing, indent) stays byte-identical.
 *     This is the whole reason write-back panels edit TEXT and not the IR:
 *     `toStrudel` is a whole-statement canonical regenerator that would
 *     reformat the leaf layer (design doc Appendix A).
 *  2. **Own-edit visible** — while an edit is applied, the writer holds its
 *     source tag, so a surface's `onDidChangeModelContent` listener can ask
 *     `isCommitting(writer)` and tell its own write (keep what it shows) from an
 *     external one (re-read the document). Monaco's content-change event
 *     carries no source of its own, so the tag is set synchronously around the
 *     edit — the listener fires inside `pushEditOperations`, while it is up.
 *     Product code reads only WHETHER a tag is set, never which one (#1914);
 *     the tag names the surface for a reader of this code, not for a listener.
 *  3. **One undo step** — every write is a single `pushEditOperations`, so even
 *     a multi-cell drag is one Ctrl-Z.
 *
 * Range discipline: offsets come from a `ChunkInfo` and are valid ONLY against
 * the exact doc it was detected from. A panel re-detects its chunk against the
 * live document in the same turn it writes; `commitToFile` compares the whole
 * document instead. Stale offsets corrupt unrelated code.
 *
 * The pure helpers (`formatNumber`, `normalizeEdits`) are string/number math
 * with no Monaco dependency, so they unit-test with plain assertions. The
 * `Writeback` class is the thin Monaco-bound shell, observed in the app.
