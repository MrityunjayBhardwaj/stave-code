/**
 * A stack arm is addressable by its own source span (#950).
 *
 * The song timeline partitions LANES by IR structure — one lane per stack arm —
 * but attributes MARKS by source containment: each evaluated hap goes to the
 * lane whose `Track` wrapper `loc` is the largest one ≤ the hap's own `loc`
 * (`timelineMarks.ts` `declaredTrackAnchors` → `irLaneFor`). That only works if
 * every arm carries a distinct anchor.
 *
 * Arms coming from real `$:` statements always did — they have a statement
 * offset. Arms produced by expanding a top-level comma inside ONE statement
 * (`$: s("bd, cp")`) had no statement of their own and so got NO `loc` at all.
 * The anchor map came out empty, every hap fell back to the engine trackId
 * (identical for all arms of one statement), and all marks piled onto the first
 * arm while every later arm rendered an empty lane.
 *
 * Nothing threw. Both lanes appeared, so a lane-COUNT assertion cannot see this
 * — it passes just as happily when one of the lanes is blank. The property that
 * discriminates is that the arms have DISTINCT anchors, which is what this pins.
 *
 * Measured in the running app before the fix: `labelOffsetByLane` empty and
 * `marksByLane` `[["d1", 8]]`; after, anchors `[["d1",6],["d2",10]]` and
 * `marksByLane` `[["d1",4],["d2",4]]`.
 *
 * ── WHERE THIS NOW LIVES (#1553) ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The property is unchanged and still pinned; what moved is WHO PROVIDES IT.
 * It used to be arranged by the staged parser, which fabricated a top-level
 * `Track` wrapper per comma arm so the anchor map would see them. That reshaped
 * the parse tree to serve a presentation need, and it cost the chain: with the
 * arms wrapped there was nowhere to put the thing wrapping THEM, so `.gain()`,
 * `.sound()` and `.room()` applied to the whole stack were dropped outright —
 * six archive documents, one of which kept 7 of its 66 notes.
 *
 * The parse now states the source's own shape (`Track[Param:gain[Stack[…]]]`,
 * byte-identical to `parseStrudel`) and the per-arm lanes are derived in the
 * lane layer from `rootStackArms`. The assertions below read that layer — the
 * same question, asked of whoever answers it. `declaredTrackAnchors` keys the
 * eval-side marks from the same rule, so skeleton and marks cannot drift.

 * survives — so interrogating the wrappers would answer a question nobody is

 * `timelineMarks.declaredTrackAnchors` calls, so this pins the value the app
