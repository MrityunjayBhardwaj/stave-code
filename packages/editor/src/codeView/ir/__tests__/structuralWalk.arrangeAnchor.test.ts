/**
 * The lane's arrange anchor points INTO the arrangement (#1517).
 *
 * Every clip gesture resolves its `arrange`/`cat` call from this one number:
 * `detectArrangeAt(code, arrangeOffset)`. Get it wrong and the gesture finds no
 * combinator and declines — silently, and correctly, because it was handed an
 * anchor that resolves to nothing. There is no error to catch and nothing to
 * report, which is why this went unnoticed for the whole life of clip gestures.
 *
 * The anchor used to be the SMALLEST location on the leaf, which reads "the
 * outer call begins earliest". True for nesting and for suffix wrappers. False
 * the moment an arm names a binding declared above the call — and that is the
 * majority spelling of a real arranged song.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ASSERTION IS DELIBERATELY NOT "the anchor equals N". A byte offset is an
 * implementation detail and an arm pinned to one teaches nothing when it breaks.
 * What the anchor OWES is that the call resolves from it, so that is what is
 * asked — of the real detector the real gestures use.
