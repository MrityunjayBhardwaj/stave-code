/**
 * #1522 — A NESTED `arrange()` MUST READ AN IDENTIFIER WEIGHT, AT EVERY DEPTH.
 *
 * #1521 taught the document's numeric bindings to reach an `arrange()` at the
 * ROOT of a track, so `arrange([M*8, …])` sizes its arm instead of declining.
 * The map stopped there. Every call that recurses deeper — a `stack(…)`
 * argument, a `cat`/`slowcat`/`fastcat` arm, the pattern half of an `arrange`
 * ARM, and a binding's own right-hand side — threaded the PATTERN binding map
 * and not the numeric one, so one level down the weight went unread again:
 *
 *     let M = 2                                        → Arrange, arms=2   ✅
 *     $: arrange([M, s("bd")], [M, s("hh")])
 *
 *     let M = 2                                        → the arrange is GONE ❌
 *     $: stack(arrange([M, s("bd")], [M, s("hh")]), s("cp"))
 *
 * The failure is quieter than it sounds and that is worth stating precisely,
 * because the issue guessed otherwise: the document does NOT fall opaque. The
 * surrounding `stack` still parses, its `s("cp")` sibling still plays, and the
 * nested `arrange` alone degrades to an opaque `Builder` carrying its own
 * source text. So the timeline draws the other tracks and silently draws no
 * clips for the arranged one — a missing region, not a broken document.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THE MAP IS FOR, AND THEREFORE THE WHOLE BLAST RADIUS. `numbers` has
 * exactly ONE consumer in the parser — `evalWeightExpression`, resolving an
 * `arrange` ARM'S WEIGHT. Everywhere else it is pure transport. So threading
 * it into more call sites can change exactly one thing: an arm weight that
 * used to be unresolvable now resolves. That is why widening here is safe to
 * do across the whole family at once, and it is a fact about the code rather
 * than a hope — a reader can check it with one search for `numbers`.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CONTROLS ARE THE POINT OF THIS FILE, NOT THE HAPPY PATH. A weight is a
 * POSITION: an unreadable one cannot be defaulted to 1 the way an unreadable
 * item can be dropped, because a wrong position silently rewrites the song.
 * So `arrange([f(), …])` and `arrange([o.x, …])` must still DECLINE — at every
 * depth, before and after this change. Widening a resolver is exactly the
 * move that turns a refusal into a guess, so the refusals are asserted first.
 *
 * ⚠ BOTH PARSERS, EVERY ARM. `parseStrudelStages` delegates to this file's
 * `parseRoot`, so the fix reaches both by construction — which is precisely
 * why it must be ASSERTED rather than assumed: a shared implementation makes
 * a differential green for free. Shape first, agreement second.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT COVERED HERE, DELIBERATELY (#1547): the METHOD-chain half —
 * `s("cp").cat(arrange([M, …]))` — still declines. `applyChain` takes no
 * numeric map on either side, and a chain argument can be a LAMBDA whose
 * parameter shadows the document's `M`, so resolving there needs a scoping
 * answer this change does not have. The last arm below PINS that boundary, so
 * it fails loudly if the chain half is widened without one.
