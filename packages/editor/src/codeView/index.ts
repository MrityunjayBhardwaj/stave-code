/**
 * codeView — the one entry to the code↔view area (#1878, part of #1869).
 *
 * Everything that turns code into something a view draws, or a gesture back
 * into code, lives in this directory. This file is its only door: code outside
 * `codeView/` imports from here and from nowhere deeper.
 *
 * It starts as exactly the names the rest of the editor already used, so adding
 * it changes no behaviour. A name is added here when a view needs it; a view
 * never reaches past this file to get it.
 *
 * The three headings below are a reading guide, not a rule the compiler checks.
 *
 * FIVE FILES DO NOT COME THROUGH HERE, on purpose. They sit in the engine's
 * runtime import graph (StrudelEngine → bareCapture → mixer/stripModel →
 * mixer/gain → writeback → workspace/editorRegistry). This file loads the whole
 * area, mini-notation parser included, and the engine's graph must not: with any
 * of them imported from here, `StrudelEngine.test.ts` dies at load. They import
 * the one file they need, and are named exceptions of the boundary test (#1879).
