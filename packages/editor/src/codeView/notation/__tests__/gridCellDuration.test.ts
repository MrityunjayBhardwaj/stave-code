/**
 * gridCellDuration.test.ts — the step CELL carries how long its note sounds
 * (#1010 P4b), and the grid ops keep that length meaning what it says.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE COVERAGE GATES. P4b is a representation
 * change: it must move no number anywhere, and "no number moved" is exactly as
 * consistent with the new field being correctly populated as with it being silently
 * empty — nothing consumes it until P4c. So the field is asserted DIRECTLY, on values
 * a degenerate reader could not produce:
 *
 *   - lengths UNEQUAL to each other in one pattern (`bd hh*2 sd cp` → 2 and 1)
 *   - lengths GREATER than a column (`bd [sd sd sd]` → 3)
 *   - lengths SMALLER than a column (`[hh ~]!16` → 0.5 — a reader returning the
 *     column width cannot produce this, and neither can one returning a slot span)
 *   - a length that is neither (`[bd@0.5 - - -]` → 1/7)
 *
 * A reader that answered "1" for everything passes any test built from evenly spaced
 * single-column notes, which is most of the corpus. These are the cases that fail it.
 *
 * The sibling of `gridOnsetDuration.test.ts` (P4a, the same discipline one layer up,
 * where the axis first reached `Onset.durs`). Corpus-wide agreement with the engine
 * for every ON cell is `cell-duration.test.ts` in the app package; this file pins the
 * hand-checked cases and the ops' semantics.
