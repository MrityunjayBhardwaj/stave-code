/**
 * The grid panels' code↔view questions, asked of one bundle per grid (#1942).
 *
 * The step grid and the piano roll each used to assemble the same five codec functions
 * by hand, ask the gain serializer directly whether velocity is writable, carry the same
 * "is this Slots target a view or a write" block, and decide keep-or-reseed and the
 * write's bytes inside a React hook. Each of those answers is a question about what the
 * code says or what a model would write, so they live here, beside the codec, and the
 * panels keep only their state and gestures.
 *
 * Every function below is a composition of ops that already existed; none decides
 * anything new. `reconcileGrid` and `gridWritePlan` are `useGridModel`'s two blocks,
 * moved verbatim (#1893 split the hook from the writer; this finishes the split).
