/**
 * lengthen — make a pattern longer by whole bars (#1824).
 *
 * Two rewrites of a grid's mini-notation, both spelled as a top-level `<…>`, one
 * entry per bar — the spelling 345 of the corpus's 591 multi-cycle pitched calls
 * already use, and the one both grids draw one bar per entry:
 *
 *   duplicateBar(mini, bars)        X → <[X] [X]>,  <a b> → <a b a>,  <a b a> → <a b a b>
 *   appendEmptyBars(mini, bars, n)  X → <[X] ~>,    <a b> → <a b ~>
 *
 * The first is Logic's Step Sequencer ("When you increase the pattern length, the
 * added steps duplicate the existing pattern"), one bar per click: the new bar is
 * the one that continues the pattern's shortest repeating run of bars. The second
 * is Logic's region resize ("lengthen a MIDI region to add silence"). Whole bars
 * only: a length that is not a whole number of cycles is a polymeter against every
 * other track, and neither grid can draw it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ANSWER COMES FROM STRUDEL, NOT FROM THE SPELLING. Wrapping a pattern in
 * `<…>` gives each entry its own cycle count, so anything inside that changes from
 * cycle to cycle — a nested `<e3 g3>`, a `?`, a `/2` — plays differently after the
 * rewrite (`c3 <e3 g3>` repeated this way plays e3 e3 g3 g3, not e3 g3 e3 g3). No
 * syntax test is asked to predict that. Both rewrites are checked by querying the
 * old and new patterns and comparing them bar by bar; a rewrite that does not play
 * exactly the intended bars is refused. The same bar-by-bar reading is what says
 * which bar continues the pattern.
