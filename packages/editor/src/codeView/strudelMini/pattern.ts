/**
 * What a mini-notation string PLAYS, asked of Strudel (#1971, part of #1869, epic #1007).
 *
 * `miniPattern` evaluates the string with `@strudel/mini`'s own `mini()`; the pattern it
 * returns answers one question, `hits(cycle)`. The views never re-derive what sounds
 * when — they read it here. With `./tree.ts` this is the only product code that imports
 * `@strudel/mini`; the boundary test (`modellingRatchet/boundary.ts`) fails on any other.
 *
 * Kept apart from `./tree.ts` on purpose: this file loads `@strudel/core` (through
 * `mini.mjs`), and the parser half must stay importable from the engine's graph
 * without it. See the note there.
 *
 * Strudel's own hap never leaves this file (#1973). A caller gets a `MiniHit`: plain
 * data, with every location already in the coordinates of the string it passed in. The
 * two rules a caller no longer knows:
 *   1. which haps are hits — the ones with an onset and a whole span;
 *   2. `mini()` evaluates the string QUOTED, so every location Strudel reports counts
 *      the opening quote. It is taken back off here, once.
 * `./joined.ts` pairs these hits with the nodes of `./shape.ts`.
