/**
 * One joined tree: what was written, paired with what it plays (#1973, part of #1869,
 * epic #1007).
 *
 * `./shape.ts` says what is written and where; `./pattern.ts` says what plays and which
 * bits of text each hit names. This file joins the two for one cycle, once, so a view
 * can ask a node "which hits are yours" and a hit "which note wrote you" without
 * matching spans itself.
 *
 * THE RULE, measured rather than assumed (1,625 corpus patterns, 52,498 hits, 2026-10-08):
 *   - a hit names one location per atom that shaped it: the written note, and the
 *     atoms of any op argument on the way (`*2`'s `2`, a euclid's numbers, `:3`'s `3`,
 *     a range's far end, a polymeter's `%4`);
 *   - the written note is NOT always first — `sd:2`, `0 .. 3` and `{a b c}%4` report
 *     the argument first (2,192 hits);
 *   - Strudel takes SPACES off a location and nothing else, so a token followed by a
 *     newline or a tab has a location one longer than its text (1,024 locations).
 * So a location is matched with whitespace taken off both ends, against each atom's
 * tight span, and a hit's note is the ONE matched atom that sits in a sequence rather
 * than in an argument. On the corpus every hit has exactly one; a hit that has none or
 * several is handed back saying which, never dropped and never guessed.
 *
 * ⚠ Like `./pattern.ts` this is on the evaluator's side: it takes a `MiniPattern`. The
 * engine's import graph must not reach it; a test keeps it out.
