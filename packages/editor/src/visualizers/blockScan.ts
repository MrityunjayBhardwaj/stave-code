 * tracks get a `_` prefix (`$:` → `_$:`, the P-MIX-5 mute idiom) and a bare
 * non-muteable expression is wrapped in a `/* … *​/` block comment. The engine
 * then computes each inline viz's `afterLine` from that overlaid source.
 *
 * A block-end scan that only recognizes `$:`/`setcps` as boundaries treats the
 * silenced `_$:` / `/*` lines as CONTINUATION of the preceding block, so a
 * soloed track greedily absorbs every following silenced line, its end line
 * overruns to EOF, and the inline viz zone re-anchors under an unrelated track.
 * Recognizing the silenced forms here keeps each zone pinned to its own track.
