/**
 * mountVizPreview — render a viz LIVE, muted, into a small container (#838).
 *
 * The single app-facing seam for the viz-library card's ShaderToy-style hover
 * preview: given a viz's raw source (renderer kind + code), it mounts the real
 * worker viz into `container` and drives it from the muted drum-pattern demo
 * feed (`demoSignalSource`) so an audio-reactive shader animates while nothing
 * is playing and no sound is produced. The worker presents directly onto the
 * on-screen canvas — there is NO frame readback / ImageBitmap capture.
 *
 * Worker-ONLY by design: the demo feed is a worker `SignalFrame` stream, and the
 * user wants previews rendered in the dedicated viz worker. Where the worker path
 * is unavailable (old/non-isolated browser, flag off) this returns `null` and the
 * caller keeps its static baked/placeholder tile — a preview is a best-effort
 * enhancement, never a requirement.
 *
 * Teardown is the caller's responsibility on mouse-leave: call `disconnect()`,
 * which stops the ResizeObserver/lifecycle AND destroys the renderer so the
 * worker + its GPU context are released immediately (only one preview is ever
 * alive, so the shared GPU never accumulates contexts — P122).
 *
 * REF: mountVizRenderer (the shared preview lifecycle), WorkerVizRenderer
 *      (setDemoSource), demoSignalSource, [[project_asset_library]] (#838).
