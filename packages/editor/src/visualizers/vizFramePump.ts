/**
 * vizFramePump — the single rAF clock + shared sampler for ALL worker viz (PV72,
 * #302). The MAIN-THREAD-side partner to `vizGovernor`: the governor coordinates the
 * TOTAL GPU frame budget (the GPU-bound heavy-viz case, P122); this pump collapses the
 * duplicated MAIN-THREAD per-frame SAMPLE work (the many-LIGHT-viz case).
 *
 * ── Why this exists ──
 * Before this, each `WorkerVizRenderer` ran its OWN `requestAnimationFrame` loop and
 * its OWN `MainSignalSampler.sample()`. With N worker viz the per-frame analyser
 * reads + scheduler queries ran N times — B-4 (#249) measured `viz.worker.sample`
 * ≈0.33ms per call, FLAT in N → the duplicated read is the only per-viz main cost
 * that scales. The frame is NOT shareable wholesale (the analyser buffers are
 * transfer-detached, and inline zones bind PER-TRACK so the scheduler/bumps/seq are
 * genuinely per-viz, viewZones.ts:341). So the pump shares the EXPENSIVE READ, not the
 * frame: one rAF, one `FrameSampleCache` per tick that dedups analyser reads +
 * shared-scheduler queries by input-object identity. Each renderer still builds its
 * OWN frame (own sampler/bumps/seq → byte-identical reactivity, PV75).
 *
 * ── What it owns ──
 *   - ONE `requestAnimationFrame` loop, alive only while ≥1 renderer is registered.
 *   - ONE `vizGovernor.observeFrame(ts)` per tick (was per-renderer; idempotent per
 *     ts, so this is equivalent — and now there's exactly one caller).
 *   - A fresh `FrameSampleCache` per tick, passed to every registered renderer.
 *
 * Each registered renderer (`PumpDriven`) keeps ALL its existing per-viz gates
 * (#261 backpressure, maxFps cap, `governor.mayProduce`, resolution lever, paused) —
 * the pump just calls `pumpTick(ts, cache)` instead of the renderer self-scheduling.
 * Registration is on the renderer's start (mount/resume); unregister on stop
 * (pause/destroy) — mirrors `vizGovernor.register`/`unregister` exactly so the two
 * stay in lockstep.
 *
 * The main-thread `P5VizRenderer` / `HydraVizRenderer` / `GLSLVizRenderer` fallback
 * paths are NOT driven here — they keep their own draw loops; only worker renderers
 * (whose sample work is the duplicated cost) join the pump.
 *
 * REF: PV72, vizGovernor.ts (the sibling cadence owner + observeFrame), PV80/#261
 *      (the per-viz backpressure this preserves), PK22 (1:1 cadence), frameSampleCache.ts,
 *      WorkerVizRenderer.pumpTick (the gate sequence), #302.
