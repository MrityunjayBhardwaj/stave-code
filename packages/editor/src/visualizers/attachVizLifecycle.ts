/**
 * attachVizLifecycle — THE single choke point for the per-mount viz concerns that
 * MUST attach to every mounted renderer (PV74 / #260): `renderer.mount()` + the
 * Phase C visibility pausing (`registerVizVisibility`, #258). A viz attaches to
 * the DOM at TWO seams and there is no shared mount path:
 *   - `mountVizRenderer` — picker (`useVizRenderer`/`VizPanel`), backdrop
 *     (`compiledVizProvider`), crop preview (`CropPopup`). Wraps this + a
 *     ResizeObserver.
 *   - `viewZones` — inline `.viz()` Monaco zones. Wraps this + a teardown wrapper
 *     (#263), Monaco-layout reflow, crop, decorations, action bar.
 * Routing BOTH through here means a future per-mount concern of this class wires
 * ONCE, not twice — closing the P107 footgun (a concern wired into only one seam
 * was silently dead on the other). Concerns that genuinely DIVERGE by seam
 * (resize: ResizeObserver vs Monaco-layout; teardown-wrap; crop) stay at the call
 * site — they are not "wire both" concerns and forcing them together would be the
 * wrong abstraction.
 *
 * Returns a `detach` that unwires ONLY what this attached (the visibility
 * registration). It does NOT call `renderer.destroy()` — the caller owns the
 * renderer's lifetime (both seams destroy their renderers themselves).
 *
 * `onMountError` lets a seam SWALLOW a mount throw and still wire visibility
 * (viewZones logs + continues so one bad zone can't abort the others); omit it and
 * a mount throw propagates (mountVizRenderer's contract).
 *
 * REF: PV74 (the two-seams invariant), P107 (the doc-lie that made inline wiring
 * dead), PK27 (#260 gate), vizVisibility.ts (registerVizVisibility),
 * mountVizRenderer.ts + viewZones.ts (the two callers).
