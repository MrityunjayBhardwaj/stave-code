/**
 * WorkerBusFeed — drives a (pure) `SignalBus` from `SignalFrame`s on the WORKER
 * side (Phase B / B-2). The worker bus is the SAME `SignalBus` class as on main;
 * this feed reconstructs the bus's three inputs from a transported frame and runs
 * the per-frame sequence, so `bus` yields the same readings as a main-fed bus.
 *
 * No DOM, no worker API, no transport — pure object plumbing over `SignalBus`'s
 * public seams. Lives equally happily in a unit test (parity gate) or the real
 * `viz-worker` (B-3).
 *
 *   analysers → byte-backed `BusAnalyser` stubs whose identity is STABLE across
 *               frames (keyed by analyser key) so `SignalBus`'s per-analyser
 *               scratch-buffer cache (WeakMap on the stub) keeps hitting.
 *   scheduler → a minimal `IRPattern` stub `{ now, query }` returning the frame's
 *               `now` + active events (the bus only calls those two — IRPattern.ts).
 *   bumps     → replayed into `bus.bump()` (the envelope feed).
 *
 * Per-frame order (the worker frame contract): replay bumps → `tick()` →
 * `refreshActive(now)` → `readAudio()`. `readAudio` MUST follow `refreshActive`
 * (SignalBus Slice-2 ordering — `audioFor` resolves a sound→track via the active
 * map). The reference main-bus in the parity gate is driven the same way.
