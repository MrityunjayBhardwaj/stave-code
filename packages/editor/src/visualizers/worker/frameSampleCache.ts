/**
 * FrameSampleCache — the per-rAF-tick memo that makes the shared frame pump a win
 * (PV72, #302). It collapses the work that N worker viz duplicate every frame when
 * they read the SAME live input object:
 *
 *   - ANALYSER READS — the expensive `getByteFrequencyData` (an FFT magnitude
 *     recompute + dB + byte quantize, O(fftSize)) on a SHARED master analyser runs
 *     ONCE per tick; each consumer gets its own TRANSFER-SAFE copy (a cheap slice),
 *     because `frameTransferables` detaches the buffer on postMessage (a single read
 *     could only be transferred to one worker). 1 FFT + k slices ≪ k FFTs.
 *   - SCHEDULER QUERIES — a `query(a,b)` over the SAME (scheduler, window) runs ONCE;
 *     the result is shared BY REFERENCE across consumers (each `.map`s it read-only,
 *     and postMessage structured-clones it per worker), so there is no per-consumer
 *     cost beyond the one query. Distinct schedulers (per-track binding,
 *     viewZones.ts:341) key separately → no false sharing.
 *
 * Constructed fresh by `vizFramePump` each tick and discarded after the tick — so it
 * can never serve a stale read across frames. Keyed by INPUT-OBJECT IDENTITY (not a
 * string key): two viz sharing the master analyser object hit the cache; two viz on
 * different track analysers don't (their data genuinely differs).
 *
 * Generic over the read/query implementations (injected by the caller) so this module
 * imports no sampler internals and stays DOM-free / plain-object testable.
 *
 * REF: PV72, signalSampler.ts (the injector), signalFrame.ts:frameTransferables (why
 *      copies are needed), viewZones.ts:341 (per-track binding → identity keys), #302.
