/**
 * WorkerVizRenderer — a `VizRenderer` that runs the p5 sketch in an
 * OffscreenCanvas Web Worker, off the main thread (Phase B / B-3, epic #228).
 *
 * It is the MAIN-side counterpart to `hostP5Worker`:
 *   - `mount`   — create a `<canvas>`, `transferControlToOffscreen()`, spawn a
 *     worker (via the app-injected factory), post a `mount` with the sketch CODE
 *     STRING + transferred canvas, and start ONE main `requestAnimationFrame`
 *     loop that `sample()`s the live signal feed + `writeFrame()`s it to the
 *     worker. That rAF is the single clock — the worker draws exactly one frame
 *     per `writeFrame` (1:1 → cadence can't drift; PK22).
 *   - `update`  — rebind the sampler's live inputs (re-evaluate swaps analysers /
 *     scheduler / hap stream), mirroring P5VizRenderer.update.
 *   - `resize`  — forward the new size + DPR to the worker.
 *   - `pause`/`resume` — stop/start the sampling loop + tell the worker.
 *   - `destroy` — stop the loop, tell the worker to tear down, terminate it.
 *
 * The ONLY per-frame main-thread cost is `sample()` (read analyser bytes + ONE
 * wide scheduler query + now) + a transferable `postMessage` — the heavy
 * `draw()` is gone from main. That residual is what the matrix measures (PLAN §8).
 *
 * Falls back is NOT handled here: `makeRenderer` only constructs a
 * WorkerVizRenderer when a worker factory is registered AND the transport is
 * worker-capable; otherwise it builds a `P5VizRenderer`. If the factory is
 * somehow absent at mount, `mount` reports via `onError` so the host can recover.
 *
 * REF: hostP5Worker.ts, signalSampler.ts, signalTransport.ts, vizWorkerFactory.ts,
 *      P5VizRenderer.ts (the lifecycle + alias contract mirrored here), PK22.
