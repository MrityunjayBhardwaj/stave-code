/**
 * samplePeaks — the min/max envelope of a decoded sample, so the Song timeline
 * can draw what a sound actually looks like (#1506, the mechanism #900 describes).
 *
 * ## Why this lives in the editor
 *
 * The app cannot reach any of the audio it draws. It depends on `@strudel/mini`
 * and nothing else from the Strudel family, while `superdough` — which owns both
 * the sample registry and the decoded-buffer cache — arrives only through
 * `@strudel/webaudio`, an editor dependency (`@strudel/webaudio/index.mjs:11`
 * re-exports superdough wholesale). This is the same route `assetStore.ts` takes
 * for `samples`.
 *
 * That constraint happens to point the same way the design does. The side that
 * owns playback is the side that can answer "which bytes are these?", and a
 * waveform resolved anywhere else would be a second opinion about what plays —
 * exactly the drift #900 warns about when it asks for the drawn shape to reflect
 * the sound rather than the file.
 *
 * ## The cache is cold until something plays
 *
 * `getCachedBuffer` reads a map that `loadBuffer` fills only once a fetch and a
 * decode have both completed (`superdough/sampler.mjs:86-101`). A page that has
 * not played yet has none of it. So every read here is allowed to return null,
 * and callers are expected to treat a missing waveform as "not yet" rather than
 * as an error — the timeline simply draws the mark it drew before.
 *
 * One thing worth writing down because the library says otherwise: superdough
 * labels that cache `string: Promise<ArrayBuffer>` (`sampler.mjs:14`). It is
 * neither a promise nor an ArrayBuffer. `sampler.mjs:100` stores the *decoded*
 * buffer, and the accessor at `:17` is synchronous. Reading the comment instead
 * of the code costs an `await` on a value that never settles.

/**
 * Envelope resolution held per sample, independent of zoom — the FLOOR.

 * at draw time, rather than cached per (sample, pixel width). The alternative
 * thrashes: a mark's width changes on every zoom step and on every window
 * resize, so a width-keyed cache would recompute the whole envelope for a
 * scroll gesture and hold an entry per width it ever saw.
 *
 * 1024 is well past what a mark playing the WHOLE of a short sample can show.
 * It is not enough for a long file played in slices (#1736): a mark shows only
 * its slice, so the detail it needs scales with the file's length. That is
