/**
 * Phase 10.2 — Workspace type vocabulary.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for workspace-level types. Each
 * task in Phase 10.2 appends its own type surface here:
 *
 * - Task 01 (this task): WorkspaceFile, WorkspaceLanguage.
 * - Task 02: AudioSourceRef, AudioPayload, WorkspaceAudioBus.
 * - Task 03: EditorViewProps, PreviewViewProps.
 * - Task 04: WorkspaceTab, WorkspaceGroup, WorkspaceLayout.
 * - Task 05: LiveCodingRuntime, LiveCodingRuntimeProvider, ChromeContext.
 * - Task 06: PreviewProvider, PreviewContext.
 *
 * Keep this file type-only. No runtime code, no imports that bring in React
 * or DOM APIs. The types must be consumable from unit tests that run in a
 * plain Node environment.

/**
 * The set of languages a WorkspaceFile may declare. This is an explicit
 * string-literal union rather than an open string so that the exhaustiveness
 * checker inside providers catches unhandled cases. New languages are added
 * here as new provider registries land (e.g., Phase 7+ may add `.tidal`).

/**
 * A single editable file owned by the workspace. Instances are **immutable
 * snapshots**: `setContent` replaces the record in the store instead of
 * mutating the object in place. This is load-bearing for
 * `useSyncExternalStore` snapshot identity — consumers compare by reference,
 * so a new object on content change is what triggers their re-render, and
 * an unchanged reference on unrelated content changes is what prevents
 * spurious re-renders.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `meta` bag is an escape hatch for per-file data that does not belong
 * in the store's public API (e.g., provider-specific viz preset ids in
 * Phase 10.2, cursor position in Phase 10.3). Treat it as opaque — callers
 * should namespace their keys to avoid collisions.
