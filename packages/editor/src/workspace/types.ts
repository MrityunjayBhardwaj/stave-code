/**
 * Phase 10.2 — Workspace type vocabulary.
 *
 * This file is the single source of truth for workspace-level types. Each
 * task in Phase 10.2 appends its own type surface here:
 *
 * - Task 01 (this task): WorkspaceFile, WorkspaceLanguage.
 * - Task 02: AudioSourceRef, AudioPayload, WorkspaceAudioBus.
 * - Task 03: EditorViewProps, PreviewViewProps.
 * - Task 04: WorkspaceTab, WorkspaceGroup, WorkspaceLayout.
 * - Task 05: LiveCodingRuntime, LiveCodingRuntimeProvider, ChromeContext.
 * - Task 06: PreviewProvider, PreviewContext.
 *
 * Keep this file type-only. No runtime code, no imports that bring in React
 * or DOM APIs. The types must be consumable from unit tests that run in a
 * plain Node environment. Type-only imports (`import type ...`) are erased
 * at compile time and are safe to add when a downstream task needs to
 * reference engine-layer types from the workspace public surface.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Task 03 adds `EditorViewProps` and `PreviewViewProps`. These DO depend
 * on React types (`ReactNode`) but the imports are type-only and erased at
 * compile time, so the "no React runtime imports" rule is preserved. The
 * concrete `PreviewProvider` interface lives in its own file
 * (`PreviewProvider.ts`) because it contains more than a type — it's a
 * behavioral contract Task 06 will key a registry on.

 * matches the previous payload, subscribers do NOT re-fire. This keeps the
 * bus out of the per-frame FFT read path; consumers reach into
 * `payload.analyser` directly for that.
 *
 * ## Optionality

/**
 * Per-file runtime that wraps a `LiveCodingEngine`. Created by a
 * `LiveCodingRuntimeProvider.createEngine`-derived factory inside Task 09's
 * compat shims (and Task 10's app rewire). Owns the engine lifecycle for a
 * single workspace file id, publishes its component bag to the workspace
 * audio bus when playing, and unpublishes on stop / dispose.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## What the runtime is, and is not
 *
 * - **Is** a strict passthrough wrapper around an engine plus the bus
 *   publish/unpublish wiring required to surface the engine's component
 *   bag to viz consumers and the EditorView (for inline view zones / S7).
 * - **Is** the elevation point for `BufferedScheduler` (S8) — when an
 *   engine ships streaming + audio without a native queryable, the
 *   runtime constructs a `BufferedScheduler` lazily on first `play()` and
 *   places it on the published payload's `scheduler` slot.
 * - **Is NOT** a place to install Pattern.prototype interception (PV2 / P2).
 *   All Strudel Pattern method wrappers are installed inside
 *   `StrudelEngine.evaluate()`'s setter trap and live nowhere else. The
 *   runtime never reads, writes, or proxies anything on `Pattern.prototype`.
 * - **Is NOT** a place to mutate `file.content` before evaluation (P1).
 *   The runtime passes the file content unchanged into `engine.evaluate`.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle (PK1 — STRICT)
 *
 * `play()` runs nine ordered steps with no React state writes interleaved
 * between `engine.evaluate()` resolving and `bus.publish()` firing:
 *
 *   1. `await engine.init()` if not already initialized.
 *   2. `await engine.evaluate(getFileContent())`.
 *   3. If `error` — fire `onError`, do not publish, do not call play.
 *   4. SYNCHRONOUSLY read `engine.components` (no awaits between here and
 *      step 7).
 *   5. Determine the queryable scheduler. Native if `components.queryable`,
 *      otherwise elevate via `BufferedScheduler` (S8).
 *   6. Build the `AudioPayload` with `hapStream`, `analyser`, `scheduler`,
 *      `inlineViz`, and the full `audio` slot.
 *   7. `workspaceAudioBus.publish(fileId, payload)` — subscribers fire SYNC.
 *   8. `engine.play()` — schedules audio.
 *   9. Fire `onPlayingChanged(true)`.
 *
 * The `publish` BEFORE `play` ordering matters: viz consumers and the
 * EditorView's inline-zone subscription must see the payload before the
 * first hap event fires. The `publish` AFTER `evaluate` ordering matters
 * even more: only after `evaluate` resolves does `engine.components`
 * contain the captured `inlineViz.vizRequests` for the current code.

 *   never calls `createEngine`; it only passes the list to `chromeForTab`.
 * - No preview provider registry lookup — `previewProviders` is a slot
 *   for Task 06 to populate. Task 04 uses a single `previewProviderFor`
 *   callback to resolve the provider at render time so the shell is
 *   testable in isolation with a stub.
