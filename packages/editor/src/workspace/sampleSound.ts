/**
 * sampleSound — test audio source for viz development.
 *
 * A self-contained sawtooth oscillator with an LFO-modulated pitch that
 * feeds an `AnalyserNode`, plus a virtual `PatternScheduler` that
 * returns a repeating 4-note arpeggio synced to the LFO period. The
 * payload is published to the `workspaceAudioBus` under the fixed
 * source id `__sample__` so the user can pick "Sample sound" in a viz
 * tab's source dropdown and see both FFT-reactive shaders AND
 * scheduler-driven sketches (like the default pianoroll) react to a
 * predictable source without needing to play a real pattern first.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Design
 *
 * The sample sound is a **singleton** — one shared `AudioContext`,
 * oscillator graph, `AnalyserNode`, and virtual `PatternScheduler`.
 * Multiple viz previews pinning to `__sample__` all see the same FFT
 * data AND the same scheduler, which is what you want for "test the
 * viz with a known-stable audio source."
 *
 * ## Why an LFO-modulated sawtooth, specifically
 *
 * A pure sine at one frequency produces a single FFT spike that
 * doesn't move — the viz looks dead. A sawtooth produces a rich
 * harmonic series (multiple bins lit up), and modulating its frequency
 * with a slow LFO makes those bins shift over time. The result is a
 * visibly animated FFT without needing a complex score.
 *
 * ## Why a 4-note arpeggio for the virtual scheduler
 *
 * The pianoroll default (PIANOROLL_P5_CODE) polls
 * `stave.scheduler.query()` every frame and draws rectangles for the
 * returned events. Without a scheduler payload, the pianoroll shows
 * only the analyser spectrum — no notes. A minimal virtual pattern
 * lets users see their sketch respond to "pattern-like" data while
 * testing.
 *
 * The pattern is a 4-note A-minor arpeggio (A3, C4, E4, G4) with
 * each note holding for 0.5 seconds, cycling every 2 seconds — the
 * same period as the LFO sweep, so the visible note changes
 * roughly coincide with the audible pitch drift.
 *
 * ## Audibility
 *
 * The output routes to `ctx.destination` with a low gain (0.05) so the
 * user can actually HEAR the test audio. Most viz developers want to
 * hear what they're visualizing — muting it would require the user to
 * trust that audio is "there" purely on visual evidence. Setting a
 * low gain keeps it audible without being annoying.
 *
 * ## Lifecycle (user-driven)
 *
 *   - `start()` — lazy-initializes the AudioContext, oscillator graph,
 *     analyser, and scheduler on first call. No-op if already playing.
 *     Must be called from a user gesture (click handler) per browser
 *     autoplay policy.
 *   - `stop()` — disconnects nodes, unpublishes from the bus, closes
 *     the context. Called when the user selects a different source.
 *   - `isPlaying()` — query for UI state.
 *
 * ## Bus payload shape
 *
 * Publishes an `AudioPayload` with:
 *   - `analyser` — live FFT data from the oscillator
 *   - `audio: { analyser, audioCtx }` — nested component shape for
 *     consumers that read from `payload.audio`
 *   - `scheduler` — virtual `PatternScheduler` returning the arpeggio
 *   - `hapStream` — a fresh empty `HapStream`. The sample sound does
 *     NOT emit hap events in the current revision — event-driven
 *     sketches that subscribe via `hapStream.on()` see nothing. The
 *     field is populated for payload-shape completeness only.
 *
 * ## Identity guard interaction (D-01)
 *
 * The bus's identity guard (`payloadsEquivalent` in `WorkspaceAudioBus`)
 * treats same-ref publishes as no-ops. We publish ONCE on `start()`
 * with a stable payload — the live FFT data updates happen inside the
 * analyser node, not via re-publishing. The scheduler's `now()` reads
 * `ctx.currentTime` per call, so consumers get fresh time every frame
 * without needing a re-publish either.
