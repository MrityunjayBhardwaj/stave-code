/**
 * assetStore — where a user's bytes live (#1500, Phase 1 of #1352; decision #1499).
 *
 * Four features wanted somewhere to put binary data and none of them owned it
 * (#1499). This is that place: content-addressed blobs in IndexedDB, with the
 * document holding a reference rather than the bytes. Blobs cannot live in a
 * CRDT — a `Y.Text` carrying megabytes of base64 would wreck sync, undo and
 * document size — so the split is bytes here, `AssetRecord` in the doc.
 *
 * This module is the I/O half. Every decision that can be made from plain
 * values lives in `assetNaming.ts` and is unit-tested there; this file is the
 * thin part that cannot be, and is observed in a browser instead
 * (`asset-store-roundtrip.spec.ts`).
 *
 * ## Why the store opens through `openIdbWithTimeout`
 *
 * A raw `indexedDB.open` can hang forever — blocked by another tab's older
 * connection, rejected in private mode, corrupted — and that was the boot hang
 * (#685/#687). Four stores already route through the shared bounded opener; a
 * fifth that opened raw would reintroduce the exact failure the helper exists
 * to bound. Callers of this module catch and degrade, they do not await
 * indefinitely.
 *
 * ## Why object URLs are cached
 *
 * `URL.createObjectURL` mints a handle that pins the blob until it is revoked.
 * The sampler asks for a URL on the path to every note, so minting per call
 * leaks one blob handle per note — the leak grows with playback time, which is
 * the worst shape to discover later. The cache is keyed by content hash, which
 * is also what makes the dedup real: two records naming the same bytes share
 * one URL, not two.
 *
 * ## Why registration goes through `samples()`
 *
 * `samples(sampleMap, baseUrl)` is superdough's documented public entry
 * (`superdough/sampler.mjs:249`). It walks the map through `processSampleMap`
 * (`sampler.mjs:146`) and lands on `registerSampleSource` → `registerSample` →
 * `registerSound` (`sampler.mjs:361`, `:354`, `superdough.mjs:60`), which is a
 * plain write into the `soundMap` store — no audio context required, so an
 * asset can be registered before the engine has ever started.
 *
 * A blob URL survives that path intact: with an empty `baseUrl` the map value
 * is concatenated onto `''` (`sampler.mjs:159`), and playback bottoms out in
 * `loadBuffer` — `fetch(url) → arrayBuffer() → decodeAudioData`
 * (`sampler.mjs:88-104`). Nothing in it parses the URL or infers a format from
 * an extension, which is why a `blob:` URL with no extension decodes normally.
 */
