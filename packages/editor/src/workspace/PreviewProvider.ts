/**
 * PreviewProvider — Phase 10.2 Task 03.
 *
 * The minimal interface that `PreviewView` uses to render visual output for
 * a workspace file. Concrete providers (`HYDRA_VIZ`, `P5_VIZ`, ...) land in
 * Task 06; this file defines the shape they must satisfy and the context
 * object `PreviewView` hands to `provider.render()` on every reload.
 *
 * @remarks
 * ## Why in its own file, not `types.ts`?
 *
 * `types.ts` is the frozen vocabulary for primitive workspace values
 * (`WorkspaceFile`, `AudioPayload`, `AudioSourceRef`). The provider
 * contract is a behavioral interface tied to the concrete provider
 * registry, and it references React types (`React.ReactNode`) that
 * `types.ts` is meant to stay clear of (the comment on `types.ts` is
 * explicit: "No runtime code, no imports that bring in React or DOM
 * APIs"). Hoisting `PreviewProvider` into its own file keeps `types.ts`
 * framework-agnostic and gives Task 06's registry a natural place to
 * import from.
 *
 * ## Contract surface
 *
 * Every provider exposes:
 *
 * - `extensions` — the set of file extensions the provider claims. The
 *   Task 06 registry keys lookups by this set.
 * - `label` — human-readable provider name for UI affordances (dropdown
 *   tooltip, error messages).
 * - `keepRunningWhenHidden` — per CONTEXT D-03. `true` means the provider
 *   wants to keep rendering even when its tab is hidden (e.g., long-lived
 *   audio visualizers that need to track state continuously). `false`
 *   means `PreviewView` pauses the render loop by passing `hidden: true`
 *   through the context AND freezing the debounce timer.
 * - `reload` — per CONTEXT D-07. Three modes:
 *     - `'instant'` — re-render on every file content change, no debounce.
 *     - `'debounced'` — re-render after `debounceMs` of quiescence. Used
 *       for compilation-heavy providers (HYDRA_VIZ, P5_VIZ) where every
 *       keystroke shouldn't trigger a full compile.
 *     - `'manual'` — provider handles its own reload trigger.
 *       `PreviewView` never re-renders on content change; the provider is
 *       responsible for watching the file itself or exposing a reload
 *       button in its rendered output.
 * - `debounceMs` — required when `reload === 'debounced'`. Ignored
 *   otherwise.
 * - `render(ctx)` — returns a `ReactNode` that `PreviewView` mounts. Every
 *   reload replaces the returned node (PreviewView handles the React
 *   reconciliation). Providers that need to preserve state across reloads
 *   must do so inside their returned component via refs/closures; the
 *   `PreviewView` host does not persist anything on their behalf.
 *
 * ## PreviewContext — what the provider sees
 *
 * - `file` — the current `WorkspaceFile` snapshot. Reactive via
 *   `useWorkspaceFile` inside `PreviewView`; every render gets the latest
 *   content.
 * - `audioSource` — the current `AudioPayload | null` for the tab's
 *   `sourceRef`, taken from the bus subscription. `null` means no
 *   publisher matches the ref; the provider is responsible for showing
 *   demo-mode fallback content (P7 — the host must not paper over null
 *   with a placeholder).
 * - `hidden` — true when the tab is hidden AND the provider opted out of
 *   background rendering (`keepRunningWhenHidden === false`).
