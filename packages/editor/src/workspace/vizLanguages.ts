/**
 * vizLanguages — the single home for the viz `language` ↔ renderer `kind`
 * correspondence.
 *
 * ## Why this module exists
 *
 * A workspace file's `language` (`'p5js' | 'hydra' | 'glsl'`) maps to a
 * concrete renderer `kind` (`'p5' | 'hydra' | 'glsl'`), and the inverse.
 * Before this module that correspondence was duplicated as inline ternaries
 * and `language === 'p5js' || 'hydra'` allow-list filters across ~13 call
 * sites in the editor and app packages. Adding the GLSL renderer kind (#287)
 * meant threading `'glsl'` through every one of them — and the easily-missed
 * sites were the **filters**: a union-widen forces the type system to make you
 * add a ternary arm, but an allow-list filter compiles fine while silently
 * excluding the new kind, so the feature just no-ops (P118 / PV88 — the
 * named-viz registration filter and the backdrop filters dropped `'glsl'`
 * invisibly to tsc + unit tests; found only by live observation).
 *
 * Consolidating into one helper means:
 *   - the allow-list (`VIZ_LANGUAGES`) has ONE definition every filter calls,
 *     so a new kind can't be silently dropped by a forgotten filter, and
 *   - the maps are exhaustive `Record`s keyed by the renderer union, so a new
 *     renderer kind is a compile error until every arm is added — the next
 *     kind is a 1-line change, not a 13-site scavenger hunt.
 *
 * @see PV88 (the consolidation target), P118 (the silent-drop trap).
