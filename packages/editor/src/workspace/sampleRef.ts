 *   the alias table for `RolandTR909_kick`.
 * - `n` picks the file within the sound's list, wrapping round
 *   (`util.mjs:109-128`).
 * - `freq`, else `note`, picks the nearest key of a pitched bank
 *   (`valueToMidi`, `util.mjs:62-80`).
 *
 * ⚠ `ev.note` holds `n` when the hap had no `note` (`normalizeStrudelHap`), so a
 * `note` equal to `n` is read as that fold and dropped. The one hap this misreads
 * sets both to the same number on a pitched bank; it then picks from key 36
 * (superdough's own fallback) instead of that note.
