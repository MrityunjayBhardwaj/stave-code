/**
 * resolution.ts — pure ×2 / ÷2 grid-resolution transforms (#479).
 *
 * A flat Strudel sequence conflates LENGTH and RESOLUTION: the token count IS
 * the number of equal cycle subdivisions, so `s("bd ~ sn ~ bd")` is exactly 5
 * slots and appending a token re-times every event (grounded with real haps in
 * #479). The only RATIO-PRESERVING way to change the slot count — the standard
 * step-sequencer "Rate / resolution" control (Logic, Elektron) decoupled from
 * length — is an integer resolution change:
 *
 *   ×2  each slot splits into two; every hit keeps its position, the new
 *       in-between slots are empty (editable). `bd ~ sn` → `bd ~ ~ ~ sn ~`.
 *   ÷2  the inverse, and LOSSLESS only when every odd column is empty (a step
 *       grid) / every note starts and lasts an even number of columns (a roll).
 *       Otherwise it would drop or shorten notes, so it's disabled (the `canHalve*`
 *       predicates) — an honest control, never a silent corruption.
 *
 * Verified against real `@strudel` haps (#479): the doubled model serializes to
 * onsets byte-identical to the source — `bd ~ sn ~ bd` and its ×2 both query to
 * `[0, 0.4, 0.8]`; `note("c3 e3 g3")` and `note("c3@2 e3@2 g3@2")` both to
 * `[0, ⅓, ⅔]`. Roll notes scale duration too (a held `@n` keeps its time span).
 *
 * Pure (no React, no DOM), in the `notation/` model-op family alongside
 * `lane.ts` / `place.ts` / `resize.ts`: a transform returns the SAME model
 * reference when it can't apply, so `useGridModel.mutate` skips the write and
 * the document is left untouched.

 * #1052 settled the rule that fixes it: **refining is a view change, coarsening edits
 * your document.**
 *
 * A target is in the free zone when it is the document's own column count or a whole

 * target without respelling anything. The returned value is the view scale that draws
 * it, so `target === documentSteps` yields `UNREFINED` and refining is reversible: the
 * user can always come back to the document's own resolution the same way they left it.
 *
 * ⚠ ASKED OF `documentSteps`, NEVER `model.steps`. `model.steps` is what is DRAWN, so at
 * scale 2 on a 4-column document it reads 8 — and a free zone keyed off it would call
 * "16" a ×2 refine when it is really ×4, i.e. the offer would depend on how closely the
 * user happened to be looking. Same hazard [[PV260]] names for the stored value.
 *
 * ⚠ ARITHMETIC ONLY — this says a view is REPRESENTABLE, never that the parser will
 * actually draw it. Four projections refuse a finer view (#1117), so an offer made on
 * this answer alone would ship exactly the dead buttons #1010 P4c had to repair: a

 * in `slotState` behind `canDrawView`, which is the same private-arithmetic /
 * ask-the-real-subsystem split `structurallyCan*` and `ifGridSpellable` already use
 * above — and the default is "no free zone", so a caller that cannot prove it never
 * offers it.
 *
 * Bounded by the VIEW ceiling rather than the document's: refining expands nothing in
 * the notation, so `MAX_STEPS` (a document-expansion guard) is the wrong question and

 * placed in a column that exists only in the view is shorter than any column the
 * document can spell, so the guard refuses and the finer spelling is written
 * (`bd ~ sn ~` + a hit at drawn column 1 → `[bd bd] ~ sn ~`). A gain change leaves
 * every note its inherited `k` columns, so it halves exactly back to the source.
 *
 * Returns the model expressed at the document's resolution, or `null` when the edit
 * genuinely needs the finer spelling. An UNREFINED model is returned unchanged —
 * there is nothing to collapse, which is the case every pre-#1057 caller is in.

/* ── the SOURCE half of the inverse (#1121) ─────────────────────── */

/**
 * WHY THE COLLAPSE CANNOT BE THE RESOLUTION OP ALONE.
 *
 * `scale*To` above is the DOCUMENT's resolution control: "produce a grid at N columns".
 * It is entitled to reach that count and let the writer rebuild the notation, because
 * that is precisely what the user asked for when they clicked ÷2 — the old spelling is
 * the thing being changed.
 *
 * Used as the inverse of a VIEW refine it is too strong, and it fails in a way no
 * column-count assertion can see. It scales `steps`, cells, gains and notes, and spreads
 * `source` / `altSource` through UNTOUCHED — so a model back at 8 columns still carries a
 * source description that says `div=4`, i.e. 16. The writer's covers-check correctly
 * refuses a description that no longer describes the grid and falls to the rebuild, and
 * the rebuild is the flat spelling: `[- - - -] [cp - - -] …` came back
 * `~ ~ ~ ~ cp ~ ~ ~ …`, with `steps` right and every note in the right place.
 *
 * So the inverse has TWO halves and the op above is only one of them. The source
 * description is scaled by the refine exactly as the cells are (`div`, each region's
 * `[from, to)`, and the view content each region remembers), so undoing the refine means
 * undoing it there too — the same rule, asked of the second carrier.
 *
 * `leafSource` is deliberately absent, and the reason is STRUCTURAL rather than
 * observed: `parse.ts`'s total gate refuses to hand back any model that does not
 * report the scale it was asked for, and the leaf path anchors each note to its own
 * source span so it has no span to subdivide and carries no scale. A leaf model
 * therefore cannot reach here with a `viewScale` at all — the corpus gate's shape set
 * (which also has no `leaf` row) confirms that, it does not establish it. If that gate
 * ever changes, a stale `leafSource` would splice at refined spans, so the two must
 * move together.
 *
 * THE ONE ASSUMPTION LEFT, stated because it is silent if wrong: every quantity here
 * divides by `k` exactly, because the refine is what multiplied them. A source that
 * did not come from this refine would yield a fractional `div` — which the writer's
 * covers-check rejects, so it degrades to the rebuild this fix exists to avoid rather
 * than to a wrong splice. Wrong-and-loud is not available here; wrong-and-old is.
 *
 * ⚠ K IS A POWER OF TWO, and that is a property of the offers rather than of this code.
 * Every target comes from `RESOLUTION_PRESETS` (all powers of two) and `freeZoneScale`
 * admits one only when it is a whole multiple of the document's own count — and only a
 * power-of-two count divides a power-of-two preset. `scale*To` refuses any other ratio,
 * so a hypothetical `k=3` view declines the collapse and writes the finer spelling. That
 * is unreachable today; generalising it would be untested surface.
