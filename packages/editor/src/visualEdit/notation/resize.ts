 *
 *  - "spread" (default): preserve musical time — 8→16 moves a hit at step i to
 *    step 2i, so it sounds identical at finer resolution; shrinking quantizes
 *    hits onto the coarser grid (any hit in a bucket keeps the bucket on).
 *  - "pad": preserve step indices — append/truncate at the end, stretching or
 *    compressing the groove (hardware "pattern length" semantics).
 *
 * Multi-bar (`<...>`) patterns don't resize — their column resolution is fixed
 * by the bar groups — so both functions return the model unchanged.
