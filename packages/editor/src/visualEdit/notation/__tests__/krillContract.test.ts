/**
 * krillContract.test.ts — the shape contract for Strudel's mini AST.
 *
 * `notation/parse.ts` reads `@strudel/mini`'s krill AST directly:
 * `options_.weight`, `options_.reps`, `ops[].type_`, `stretch.arguments_.type`,
 * `bjorklund.arguments_.rotation`. NONE of that is public API. krill-parser.js
 * ships no export map and no types; the field names are Strudel's private
 * internals, and we depend on them because the alternative — re-deriving the
 * grammar ourselves — is the bug #903 removed (a hand-rolled copy drifts from
 * the original and reports the drift as "unsupported syntax").
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Depending on internals is a deliberate trade, and this
 * is the other half of it. Without this test an upstream AST change would be
 * SILENT: the adapter would read `undefined` where it expects a weight, decide
 * the notation is beyond the editable subset, and the grid would simply stop
 * opening tunes. Nothing throws — that is the documented failure mode of this
 * whole boundary (a walker returns a plausible WRONG verdict). This file turns
 * that silence into a loud, specific red.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST PIN THE VERSION. Because pinning is the more dangerous option
 * here. Every `@strudel/*` package pins `@strudel/core` and `@strudel/mini`
 * EXACTLY (1.2.6) among themselves, so the set upgrades atomically and our
 * `^1.0.0` tracks it as a single instance. An exact pin on our side would let
 * `@strudel/transpiler` move to a version wanting `mini@1.3.0` while we hold
 * 1.2.6 — installing TWO copies of mini, which registers `mini()` on `Pattern`
 * by side effect. Two Patterns is a worse failure than the drift being guarded.
 * So: track the set, and assert the shape.
 *
 * WHEN THIS GOES RED. Upstream changed the AST. Do NOT patch the assertion to
 * match. Re-dump the AST (`krill.parse('"bd@2"')`, print it), read what moved,
 * and update `parse.ts`'s adapter to the new shape — then update this contract
 * to the new truth. The diff IS the news, exactly as in `parity.test.ts`.
 *
 * Every expectation below is a fact `parse.ts` RELIES ON. If an assertion here
 * has no corresponding read in the adapter, delete it — a contract nobody
 * depends on is noise that trains people to ignore this file.
