/**
 * writeExtent.test.ts — the grid writer reports how much of the document it moved
 * (#1058).
 *
 * The corpus gate for the property lives in `@stave/app`
 * (`1058-refined-placement.test.ts`) because it needs the mini corpus and the
 * engine oracle. This is the unit half: the four paths and the two counts, on
 * fixtures small enough to read.
 *
 * WHY THE COUNTS ARE REPORTED RATHER THAN RECONSTRUCTED — the alternative
 * instrument walks `prefix`/`before`/`raw`/`after`/`suffix` back into absolute
 * byte offsets and reads a diff against them. Measured against this report over
 * 15,200 corpus asks, that walk calls 208 whole-part rebuilds "local" and gets
 * nothing wrong in the other direction, because a rebuilt one-element part and a
 * re-emitted element produce a diff of the same shape (#1137).
