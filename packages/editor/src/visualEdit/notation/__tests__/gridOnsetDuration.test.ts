/**
 * The grid reader keeps each note's LENGTH (#1010 P4a).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS PINNED AT THE READER. Three axes have now been caught being dropped
 * on the way in — duration (#1026), gain (#1027), and a sounding note omitted
 * because `part` went unread (#1028) — and each one surfaced much later as a
 * silent-corruption class, once a writer re-derived what the model never held.
 * The reader is where that class starts, so it is where the axis is asserted.
 *
 * `readGridOnsets` is exported for this test alone. That is deliberate: the
 * boundary that drops axes is the one worth being able to interrogate directly,
 * and a field nothing asserts is a field that drifts (the lesson of #1031).
 *
 * The cases are chosen so that a reader which merely returned a CONSTANT — the
 * column width, say — would fail every one of them: each pattern has notes of
 * UNEQUAL length, and two of them have lengths that are not the grid's resolution
 * at all.
