/**
 * lane.ts — pure add/remove-voice transforms for the Sequencer step grid (#516).
 *
 * A "voice" is a `StepLane` — one drum sound (e.g. `bd`, `cp`) across the step
 * columns. The serializer (`serializeStepGrid`) rebuilds the mini-notation from
 * lanes × cells: a sound present in any column appears in the output, multiple
 * lanes in a column collapse to `[a,b]`. So adding a lane is a pure model insert
 * and removing one is a filter — re-serialization is automatic and lossless.
 *
 * Add-voice STAGING (grounded #427): a freshly-added lane is all-rest, so it
 * serializes to NOTHING until the user places the first hit. `useGridModel`
 * keeps it anyway — its reseed guard compares `serialize(model)` to the source
 * mini, and an empty lane leaves that unchanged, so the staged row survives
 * re-detection and only writes to text on the first hit.
 */

/**
 * Append a new drum voice of all-rest cells. No-op when `sound` is blank or
 * already present (the serializer combines same-part lanes by membership, so a
 * duplicate sound token would be indistinguishable). The new lane inherits the
 * first lane's `part` so it lands in the part being edited rather than forcing
 * a new top-level `,`-stack.
