/* ── op admissibility: ASK THE WRITER, never predict it ──────────── */

/**
 * An op's result, or the input UNCHANGED when the writer cannot spell it.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, and why it lives here rather than in each op (#1010 P4c). The ops
 * each carried a hand-written `can<Op>` predicate that reasoned about the MODEL — "every
 * odd column is empty", "the gains are neutral", "the bars stay integral" — and from
 * that PREDICTED whether the writer would accept the result. That is a second oracle for
 * the writer's admissibility ([[PV192]]), and it broke the moment the printer's rules
 * changed: P4c made the printer preserve a note's length, which the grid can only spell
 * as a whole number of columns ≥1, and every COARSENING op scales a length below that.
 * Measured over the corpus: ÷2 went from 0 declines to 24 of the 24 units where it is
 * offered — the button present and doing nothing — plus quantize-down and
 * resize-spread-down, with no gate anywhere seeing it, because each op's A/B compared
 * that op to ITSELF ([[PK64]]) and never reached the writer.
 *
 * The rule this replaces the predictions with is one the project already proved at the
 * READ boundary and simply had not applied to the OPS:
 *
 *   prove-before-offer — `parse.ts:1638` ("the writer must reproduce the user's bytes
 *   before we offer the view at all") and `leafViewUsable` ("Asked of the REAL writer …
 *   so the check cannot drift from what an actual click does").
 *
 * So an op is admissible exactly when its result is WRITABLE, asked of the real writer.
 * One rule for every op including ops not yet written; it cannot drift from the printer;
 * and it needs no per-op length reasoning, which leaves [[PV240]]'s table alone — ÷2
 * still SCALES, it is simply not offered where scaling produces something unspellable.
 *
 * WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN CLAMP TO ONE COLUMN. Clamping would keep ÷2 working and change
 * every note's length instead (1/8 → 1/4). `SequencerGrid.tsx` never reads `duration`, so
 * that change is INVISIBLE in the panel — and #1026 already ruled on exactly this: a view
 * that cannot show duration still must not change it, because "edits locally / no silent
 * data loss" is a property of the DOCUMENT, not of the panel. An op the user explicitly
 * asked for is no licence to alter an axis the view cannot show them.
 *
 * Returning the INPUT (by reference) rather than null is what makes this composable: the
 * `notation/` op family already signals "could not apply" that way, so `mutate` skips the
 * write and every `can<Op>` reduces to `op(model) !== model` with no extra plumbing.
 *
 * NOT the same thing as leaning on an incidental refusal. `resize.ts`'s `restructured()`
 * warns against treating a writer null as a substitute for invalidating stale regions,
 * and that still holds: this gate is a deliberate admissibility question asked of the
 * writer, not a length check that happens to catch a provenance bug.

 * HOW MUCH OF THE DOCUMENT A GRID WRITE MOVED — reported by the writer, never

 *
 * "Only the touched element's bytes move" is the property #1052's whole case
 * rests on, and until now the only way to check it from outside was to walk
 * `prefix`/`before`/`raw`/`after`/`suffix` back into absolute offsets and read a
 * byte diff against them. That walk is a SECOND DESCRIPTION of the order
 * `spliceGrid` concatenates in, and it is wrong in a way its own output cannot
 * reveal: when a voided `,`-part holds a single element, rebuilding the part and
 * re-emitting that element produce a diff of the same shape. Measured over 15,200
 * asks, the walk called 208 part-rebuilds local — 0 errors the other way, so the
 * whole error runs toward the verdict nobody re-checks (#1137).
 *
 * The writer already decides both facts, one `if` each, and threw them away. This
 * hands them back.
 *
 * A UNION RATHER THAN SENTINEL COUNTS, deliberately. Only the splice path has
 * regions to count; leaf surgery anchors at each note's own span and the rebuilds
 * re-derive everything. Giving those a `0` would read as "moved nothing", which is
 * the opposite of true for a rebuild — so the shape makes the unmeasurable case
 * unrepresentable as a number instead of relying on a caller to remember.
 *
 * `rebuiltParts` carries HOW MANY REGIONS each rebuilt part held, not just how
 * many parts there were. A part holding a single element is rebuilt and re-emitted
 * to the same bytes, so that case may not be non-local at all — and a caller
 * cannot tell without this, because "which part did you rebuild" is a fact only
 * the writer has. Reporting a bare count pushes the caller into guessing it back
 * from the model, which is the same second-description mistake one level down.
 *
 * ⚠ `path` says WHICH WRITER answered, not whether anything was written. `mini` is
 * null on `'declined'` AND wherever the answering writer had no spelling — a leaf
 * splice or a rebuild can each return null on their own path. Read `mini` for "did
 * it write", `path` for "who decided". Testing one for the other is right today
 * only because no corpus placement reaches the second case.
 *
 * `regions` is reported alongside the re-emitted count because "one element moved"
 * is only a promise when there is more than one element to choose between. A unit
 * whose source is a SINGLE region covering the whole cycle — `hh(<3,7>,16)`,
 * `amen/4` — re-emits that one region and satisfies every locality rule
 * vacuously, while the write is in fact a whole-cycle re-derivation. That class
 * was found by #994's self-review and is what `vacuousLocality` routes around at
 * parse time; reporting `1 of 1` rather than `1` is what lets a caller see it.

  //                   exists to route around.
  //   `surgical`    — the ELEMENT writer owns this view and these spans are overlaid on
  //                   it. A refusal falls through to the element paths below, which is
  //                   exactly what this model did before P4d, so the fallback can only
  //                   restore today's behaviour and never introduce a write.

  // to still describe the model before either leaf writer may write, so an overlay that

  // rebuild, so it is safe only by the corpus:
  //
  // ⚠ A DATED RECORD, NOT CURRENT READINGS. These are what the corpus said when this rung
  // landed (#1236, 2026-08-13), and the claim they support is "this hoist moved nothing".
  // Restating them against today's corpus would falsify that measurement rather than
  // refresh it, so they are deliberately left at their measured values. For today's
  // writer-reach read `writer-reach.test.ts`, which holds the live floors and is swept by
  // the cap sweeps; nothing here is a floor and nothing re-derives it.

/**

 * which decide anything: `spliceRegions`' own re-emit and its sustain-ABSORB
 * fallback (both inside `spliceGrid`), plus one each in `spliceAltGrid`,
 * `spliceRoll` and `spliceAltRoll`. Each carries a one-line pointer back here.
 * (`reemitAltRegion` → `reemitRegion`, `reemitRegion` → `reemitStep` and
 * `reemitAltRoll` → `reemitRollRegion` are internal to those five and decide
 * nothing; they are annotated as such.) Named rather than numbered on purpose —
 * a line citation in this file is stale by the next edit.
 *
 * #1010's claim is that once every edit WITH A SPAN routes through byte surgery,
 * what still authors notation reduces to three irreducible cases:
 *
 *   1. adding structure where the source has no leaf
 *   2. the signal tail, which has no source span at all
 *   3. `@n` duration, which is never a location
 *
 * ⚠ A DATED OBSERVATION, not a live gate, and there is nothing left to re-run it
 * with. Measured 2026-08-17 on `0c785cf4` with a THROWAWAY probe: a counter at each
 * of the five sites, driven over `mini-corpus.json` (1,633 minis → 1,021 opening a
 * step grid, 597 a piano roll). Gestures per unit, and they differ by surface: on
 * the grid ≤2 deletes, ≤2 placements, 1 resize and one "double the resolution, then
 * place in the new slot"; on the roll ≤2 deletes, 1 resize, 1 placement. Recipe,
 * not a receipt — the probe is deleted because it can only run against an
 * instrumented copy of this file, and a committed instrument that cannot run is
 * worse than none ([[P592]]). Re-take it before quoting these digits as current.
 *
 * WHO ANSWERED EACH GESTURE (asks posed → the writer that answered):
 *
 *     grid delete      1663    leaf 1087 · splice 480 · alt  96             → 576 re-emit
 *     grid place       1030    leaf  136 · splice 782 · alt 112             → 894 re-emit
 *     grid resize       156    leaf    0 · splice 134 · alt  22             → 156 re-emit
 *     grid subdivide     934   leaf    0 · splice 873 · rebuild 61          →   0 re-emit
 *     roll delete      1097    leaf  802 · splice 206 · alt 81 · rebuild  8 → 287 re-emit
 *     roll place        537    leaf    0 · splice 467 · alt 56 · rebuild 14 → 523 re-emit
 *     roll resize       596    leaf  239 · splice 146 · alt 29 · rebuild 182→ 301 re-emit
 *
 * ⚠ THE LAST COLUMN IS ASKS REACHING A SITE, NOT ASKS IT ANSWERED. A re-emit can run
 * and the write still end in a rebuild, so the two coincide on six rows and diverge
 * on the seventh: roll resize reaches a site 301 times against a splice+alt total of
 * 175. Do not read the column as a sum of the two before it.
 *
 * THE MAPPING, and two of the three cases do not land where the issue supposes:
 *
 *   CASE 3 — `@n` duration. Every resize that reaches a writer at all reaches one of
 *     these five; on the grid byte surgery answers ZERO of 156, because a length is
 *     not a location and there are no bytes to replace at one. One site is EXCLUSIVELY
 *     this case (64 of 64 asks were resizes) — the sustain-ABSORB fallback maps to
 *     one case and one only, the only site of the five that does.
 *
 *   CASE 1 — structure with no leaf. The PLACEMENT population: 894 grid and 523 roll
 *     asks, a new note in a slot the source never indexed (#1154 — a leaf-anchored
 *     view takes one only where a rest was indexed, which is the 136 surgery does
 *     answer). ⚠ But case 1's own parenthetical — "a resolution change, subdividing"
 *     — reaches NO re-emit site at all: 934 asks, 0 hits, answered by the part
 *     rebuild inside the splice path (873) and by `rebuildGrid` (61). The mapping
 *     rests entirely on the OTHER half of that sentence.
 *
 *   CASE 2 — the signal tail. Reaches no site here. `serializeStepGain` and
 *     `serializeRollGain` call nothing in this family; the tail was never one of
 *     these writers' populations.
 *
 *   ⚠⚠ NONE OF THE THREE — the DELETE population, 576 grid + 287 roll asks. A delete
 *     HAS a span (the note's own bytes) and surgery answers most of them (1087 and
 *     802). The remainder fall through where the leaf is SHARED between columns
 *     (#1160) or where the unit carries no leaf index at all, and notation is
 *     authored for an edit that had bytes to replace. That is a fourth case, it is
 *     not irreducible, and it is filed rather than left as a silent survivor: #1295.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE INVARIANT OBSERVED RATHER THAN ASSUMED: across all 2,801 hits, NOT ONE had
 * `leafSource` set. The terminal field never falls through to a re-emit, which is
 * the safety property both ladders above assert in prose and nothing else measures.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS FAMILY IS A SUBSET OF THE AUTHORING SURFACE, AND EVERY FIGURE ABOVE IS
 * SCOPED TO THE FAMILY (#1298). #1007 defines the concern as a PROPERTY — emitting
 * Strudel text from a model — and then locates it at these functions. The two are not
 * the same set. Three emitters satisfy the property and are named by neither #1007's
 * list nor #1010's: `gridColumns` reached from `rebuildGrid` and from the part rebuild
 * in `spliceGrid` (`out += rebuilt.join(' ')`), and `serializeRollLanes` on the roll's
 * rebuild path.
 *
 * SO DO NOT READ "REACHES NO RE-EMIT SITE" AS "DOES NOT AUTHOR" — the subdivide row
 * above is exactly that trap. Its 934 asks reach none of these five sites and are
 * nonetheless the most destructive write the grid has: measured over the corpus, a
 * subdivide+place moves a p50 of 0.987 of a document ≥40 chars (n=74) where a delete
 * answered by leaf surgery moves 0.036 (n=64), and the neighbouring parts the user
 * never touched are re-spelled with it. Brackets, lanes and sustain do not survive.
 *
 * ⚠ AND CHECK WHAT A CALL DOES BEFORE COUNTING IT. `serializeStepGain` also calls
 * `gridColumns` and is NOT authoring — it uses the result as a predicate (which
 * columns carry an audible gain) and never emits it. An edge to an emitter is not an
 * authoring site; that distinction is the whole reason the family and the property
 * diverge. CASE 2 above stands unchanged for this reason.

    // THE ELEMENT COUNT IS UNCHANGED, and that is what makes this local rather than a
    // finer rebuild. We are not widening the part; we are spelling ONE of its elements
    // at a finer subdivision. Measured over the corpus: every part-void was this
    // branch, the tiling check below fired zero times, and the usable width was always
    // the shared grid.

    // This used to take the FIRST — coarsest — divisor `partColumns` accepted and
    // commit to it. But `partColumns` only answers "does every atom fall on this
    // grid"; it says nothing about the DURATIONS, which it divides by the same
    // factor. So a part read at width `g` gives a note covering one shared column a
    // length of `1/g`, and every writer below refuses a fraction of a column as
    // unspellable. Measured over the corpus, that one fractional length was the cause
    // of EVERY remaining part-void: 34 asks across 4 units, at both view scales,
    // all reaching `sustainTokens`' fractional refusal with `p.factor / growth === 3`.

    // the residual was assumed to be.

    // read makes the same length integral. The coarse read is NOT one of that list

 * Both checks stay: this one bounds WHICH MODEL an overlay may answer for, `anchorsDescribe`

 * Write a leaf-anchored grid back by editing each changed note's own bytes.

 *
 * WHICH AXES IT READS, and what it does about the others (#1235). The model carries a
 * cell's SOUND and its LENGTH. Only the sound has bytes of its own — the length is
 * spelled by what surrounds the token (`_`, `@n`, a bracket group), which is notation
 * this writer must never author. So it can write one axis and not the other, and the
 * axis it cannot write it must still be able to NOTICE: a comparison that reads only
 * tokens finds no difference on a resize, writes the source bytes back, and reports
 * them as a successful write. That is worse than throwing, because every gate
 * downstream reads the output and the output is the user's own valid document.
 *
 * Anything the model grows that the anchors do not carry has to be added here at the
 * same time, or it becomes the next silent-success path.
 *
 * Returns null — the document is left alone — for the four edits that have no
 * span to write through, three of which are the one bijection stated over again:
 *  - a hit added where no leaf exists (or a second sound stacked onto a column):
 *    writing it would mean AUTHORING notation, which is the line between adapter
 *    and printer;
 *  - two columns sharing one leaf (`bd*4`) that disagree about the result: one
 *    token cannot be two things, and letting the last writer win would silently
 *    rewrite cells the user did not touch;
 *  - anchors that no longer describe the grid, which is what a restructure
 *    (resize/quantize) leaves behind;
 *  - a note whose LENGTH moved, per the paragraph above.
 *
 * HOW BIG THE SHARED-LEAF REFUSAL IS — measured, because a refusal without a number
 * reads as an edge case and this one is half the surface (#1160). Over all 1527 corpus
 * minis, clearing every sounding cell of every leaf grid one at a time: 275 of 557
 * deletes across 82 units are refused — 49.4%. The roll's half is 288 of 577 (49.9%),
 * two rates derived independently, which is the evidence that this belongs to the leaf
 * projection rather than to either surface. `delete-admissibility.test.ts` pins both.
 *
 * On this surface the predicate is EXACT: a delete is refused iff the cleared cell's
 * own leaf backs more than one column. Not "its column" — a column holds every lane's
 * atom, and a leaf shared with a lane the user did not touch decides nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE SHARING IS USUALLY NOT SPELT ON THE TOKEN, which is why `bd*4` above is a
 * misleading example to reason from. Reading the operator adjacent to each anchor's
 * span: only 77 of 377 shared-leaf instances (20%) carry the multiplier on the token
 * (`*n`/`!n`/`@n`); the other 300 are multiplied by something ENCLOSING the token — a
 * group, an alternation, a `slow`. `bd*4` itself is 36 of 377, under a tenth. So the
 * recurring proposal to split the shared token instead of refusing would buy back at
 * most a fifth of these asks, and only by re-spelling notation the user wrote; the
 * other four fifths would mean re-authoring a construct the token merely sits inside.
 * The refusal is the cheaper honesty. See #1160 for the full measurement.

      // nothing and the anchors are built from ENGINE ONSETS. Measured over the
      // corpus, NOT ONE leaf ask round-tripped (0 of 402) — the user could not undo
      // their own delete anywhere on this path. Rests are now indexed beside the
      // anchors, so the byte replacement exists after all.
      //
      // ⚠ IT IS NOT SCOPED TO THE REST WE JUST WROTE, AND IT CANNOT BE. That was the
      // argument this branch was first written under — "those bytes are ours, so
      // restoring them authors nothing" — and it is unimplementable rather than
      // wrong: the model is re-read from the document after every write, so nothing
      // marks a `~` as one this writer produced, and `isOurs(rest)` has no data to
      // read. Allowing the undo therefore allows placing on ANY indexed rest, and
      // does: 248 of 3,584 empty cells across 17 of 82 leaf units, on pristine
      // documents nobody deleted from.
      //
      // That is defensible on its own terms rather than by inheritance. Swapping a
      // rest's bytes for a note is the most basic grid edit there is, every other
      // write path already does it, and the structure the user wrote is untouched:
      // one token becomes another in a slot that already existed. What is still
      // refused is AUTHORING a slot — every structural byte is copied, never
      // generated.
      //
      // Still the narrowest form of the swap: the column must hold NO sounding leaf
      // (so nothing is displaced), exactly one sound must be arriving (never a
      // chord), and a rest span must have been indexed for that column. Adding a

/**
 * Write a leaf-anchored ROLL back by editing each changed note's own pitch bytes —
 * the roll's half of `spliceByLeaf`, sharing its serializer and its bijection.
 *
 * Notes are compared at the column they START on, the roll's positional key (the
 * grid compares at the column a cell sits in). A note the user dropped becomes `~`
 * at its own span, a lone note whose pitch was dragged becomes the new token, and an
 * untouched note asserts ITS OWN SOURCE BYTES — which does two jobs: a leaf shared by
 * several notes (one token sounding in every bar) can be checked for agreement, and
 * the model's case fold never rides back out into the document, so `C3` stays `C3`
 * rather than coming back lowercased for the crime of being looked at.
 *
 * Returns null — the document is left alone — for every edit with no span to write
 * through, each of them the one bijection restated:
 *  - a note MOVED or RESIZED: a note's `@n` hold is not in its hap's locations at
 *    all (only the pitch is), so no span exists to splice a duration or a position
 *    through. Writing one would mean authoring `@n` syntax, which is the line
 *    between adapter and printer;
 *  - a note ADDED where no leaf exists (including a chord member renamed — with two
 *    members the new pitch has no unambiguous leaf to claim);
 *  - two notes sharing one leaf that disagree about the result, where letting the
 *    last writer win would silently rewrite a note the user never touched.
 *
 * THE SHARED-LEAF REFUSAL HERE IS THE SAME SIZE AS THE GRID'S, and that is the finding
 * rather than a coincidence: 288 of 577 cell deletes across 54 leaf rolls are refused
 * (49.9%) against the grid's 275 of 557 (49.4%), measured independently over the same
 * corpus. Two surfaces with different edit vocabularies refusing at the same rate is
 * what says the property belongs to the leaf projection itself. #1160 was filed with
 * this half unmeasured, so the population is 563 asks and not the 275 it records.
 *
 * ⚠ THOSE ROLL FIGURES MOVED WHEN THE ASK WAS CORRECTED, NOT WHEN THE WRITER WAS (#1168).
 * They were 276 of 591 (46.7%), posed by dropping one NOTE at a time — which `PianoRollGrid`
 * never does. It deletes by CELL, taking every note at a (pitch, start), and the two differ
 * on exactly the unisons. Posed as a click, 14 note-asks become 12 cell-asks and 12 of them
 * refuse, so the rate rose to within half a point of the grid's. The agreement this
 * paragraph rests on got STRONGER by asking the question the user can actually pose.
 * Pinned in `delete-admissibility.test.ts`; see `spliceByLeaf` for why splitting the
 * shared token is not the answer (only a fifth of the sharing is spelt on the token).
 *
 * ⚠ ONE RESIDUE, TRACKED AS #1164. Unlike the grid, sharing here is necessary but not
 * sufficient: 24 deletes on a shared leaf are ACCEPTED. All 24 are unisons — two
 * `,`-stacked parts at the same pitch and column — where `after` is built as a SET, so
 * dropping one leaves the pitch present, nothing enters `gone`, every anchor asserts
 * its own bytes and the document returns byte-unchanged while reporting success. The
 * set is right for telling chord members apart and cannot represent two of one pitch.

 * THE FALLBACK WHEN A LENGTH WON'T FIT THE ONE-TOKEN-PER-COLUMN SHAPE (#1120).
 *
 * `sustainTokens` spells a length as `_` sustain in the step sequence, and above

 * a group boundary needs a `_` in first position, which means nothing there. That is
 * precisely what REFINING produces: a finer view raises `div`, every source element
 * becomes a group, and every note longer than one column crosses a boundary. Held
 * notes were the one class that could not be looked at more closely.
 *
 * The way out is to stop asking one sequence to carry every lane. Written as a
 * `,`-stack — one flat part per sound, at COLUMN granularity — each part is its own
 * sequence with no internal group boundary, so a `_` always has something before it.
 * The stack is then weighted to the slot count the region owned, which is what keeps
 * its neighbours where they were:
 *
 *   region = 4 columns / 2 slots, bd held across all four, a hit at column 0
 *     one sequence   →  `[bd _] [_ _]`              ← `_` leads a group: no meaning
 *     stacked        →  `[bd _ _ _, zz ~ ~ ~]@2`    ← every part flat, group weighted
 *
 * ⚠ THE OBVIOUS SPELLING IS WRONG, and Strudel says so rather than our reading of it.
 * `[bd _, zz ~] _` looks like the same idea one level up, and it is not: a trailing
 * `_` elongates the whole GROUP, so the one-column `zz` comes back at 0.25 of a cycle
 * instead of 0.125. Every candidate here was checked against `queryArc` onsets before
 * a line of this was written.
 *
 * ⚠ FALLBACK ONLY, and that ordering is load-bearing. It runs where the flat sheet
 * already returned null, so no output that exists today can change shape — the golden
 * round-trips keep passing because this path is unreachable for anything they cover.
 * It also DECLINES rather than widening: two notes of the same sound overlapping, or
 * a length that is not a whole number of columns, have no spelling here either.
 *
 * ⚠ REFINED VIEWS ONLY, and that gate was added because the corpus caught its absence.
 * Some patterns already carry `div > 1` at their own resolution, so an ungated fallback
 * also fired there — and making the writer succeed makes the edit-safety probe pass,
 * which hands the pattern to the ELEMENT re-emitter instead of the leaf-anchored one.
 * Measured: leaf grids went 82 → 76 with no gate. That is a writer swap at the
 * document's own resolution, which #1120 never asked for and which the leaf path's
 * position as the LAST fallback exists to prevent — it copies every structural byte
 * rather than re-emitting. Scoped to `model.viewScale !== undefined`, the reach change
 * is confined to the refined views the issue is about.

 *  - a covered column that ANOTHER note starts in: `[_,b]` is a chord containing a

 *  - a sustain running past the region: regions are emitted independently and an

 *    call does not own. ⚠ This one is no longer the end of the story — `spliceGrid`
 *    answers a null here by ABSORBING the rests the note reaches into and calling
 *    again over the wider span, so the bytes become ones the call does own (#1146).
 *    The refusal below is still correct and still load-bearing; it is now a request

 *  - a `_` with nothing before it in its own sequence — the first column of a
 *    `[…]` step group, or of the region itself.
 *

  //                   surface, half of it, not an edge case.

  //                   exactly what this model did before P4e, so the fallback can only
  //                   restore today's behaviour and never introduce a write.

  // to still describe the model before either leaf writer may write, so an overlay that

  // other widening of these writers — `stackedRegion` (#1120), absorption (#1146) — was

  // measurement is the price of the placement rather than a formality:
  //
  // ⚠ A DATED RECORD, NOT CURRENT READINGS — same terms as the grid writer's block above.
  // Measured when this rung landed (#1236, 2026-08-13); the claim is that nothing moved,
  // so these digits must not be refreshed against today's corpus. `writer-reach.test.ts`
  // holds the live floors.
