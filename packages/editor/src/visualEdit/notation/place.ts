/**
 * PLACEMENT — putting a note into a view and taking one out, resolving what
 * that costs the notes already there. One module per concern, both surfaces
 * inside it, as `resize.ts` and `resolution.ts` already are.
 *
 * The roll places a pitched note at a column; the grid flips a cell in a lane.
 * Both must leave a model the writer can spell, and both do it the same way —
 * a new onset takes the room an earlier note was sounding through, so that
 * earlier note ends where the new one starts.
 *
 * HOW WIDE IS "AN EARLIER NOTE"? The answer is the WRITER'S CONSTRAINT, and it is not
 * the same on the two surfaces — which is the part that took three issues to get right.
 *
 * The grid resolves over the `,`-part's whole column, every lane in it, whatever sound
 * the lane carries. That is forced: a part's columns are serialized together, so a `_`
 * sustaining in one lane really does occupy the column an onset in another lane needs.
 * Reading it per lane was narrower than the notation it has to produce, and that was
 * #1064.
 *
 * The roll resolves over the PITCH placed, and nothing else (#1310). Its trim looked
 * like the grid's and was assumed to be forced by the same constraint, so #1064's ruling
 * was written as uniform across both surfaces. It was not forced. A roll chord lives
 * inside ONE part, and since #1310's region writer learned parallel lanes, the notation
 * can say `[c c ~ ~, [g,a,e4]@4]` — two lengths at once, in the region's own bracket. The
 * moment that became spellable, trimming the siblings stopped being the price of writing
 * the edit down and became a silent musical change with no notational need.
 *
 * So the surfaces differ on the PITCH axis on purpose, and agree on the principle: each
 * resolves over exactly the scope its writer forces, and neither trims for taste.
 *
 * This is the ONE definition of each gesture. The panels are callers, and so
 * are the corpus sweeps: a test that models the edit itself is a second oracle
 * for what an edit *is*, and it cannot catch a change in the edit — it quietly
 * keeps testing the old one (#1048).

/**
 * Does this view accept a NEW note ANYWHERE?
 *
 * The panel asks so it can state the refusal ONCE — "this view edits the notes
 * already here" — instead of rendering a surface of individually-greyed cells
 * with no reason on any of them (#1070). So the question it must answer is
 * exactly "is every placement on this surface refused?", and the answer is
 * `true` whenever at least one is taken, or when there is nothing to ask about.
 *
 * ⚠ A VIEW WITH NO EMPTY CELL ANSWERS `true`, deliberately. There is nothing to
 * grey and nothing to explain on a full grid, and answering `false` there would
 * put the banner on hundreds of corpus units that refuse nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ IT ASKS THE OP, and that is the whole of #1154's second consequence. This
 * used to return `model.leafSource == null` — a PATH inference, resting on
 * "byte surgery has no span to create, so a leaf view accepts nothing, by
 * construction". Indexing rests (#1154) gave those columns a span after all, so
 * the construction argument is simply false now: 248 of 3,584 leaf grid cells
 * across 17 of 82 leaf units are placements the writer WILL take, and inferring
 * from the path would withhold an affordance from every one of them. Derived
 * from `toggleCell`/`placeNote` for the same reason `can<Op>` is — a view-level
 * predicate that PREDICTS the op is a second oracle, and it drifts the moment
 * the op's reach moves, which is exactly what happened here ([[PV241]]).
 *
 * The roll's answer has not moved: the roll's leaf writer indexes no rests, so
 * it still refuses every one of them, and this now MEASURES that rather than
 * asserting it. Whatever the reach is, the panel reads it instead of assuming it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ROLL ASKS ABOUT ONE ROW IT DOES NOT HOLD, and that is not a flourish —
 * without it the answer is wrong on real units. The roll's display is PADDED
 * around the content (`rollContentRange`), so a roll whose every content cell is
 * full still shows empty rows and still takes a click on them. Asking only
 * about content pitches made "the content is full" read as "nothing to ask",
 * which said "this view places notes" on 4 leaf rolls where every row the user
 * can actually click is refused.
 *
 * It is consulted only once every held cell has refused, so it decides nothing
 * on a view that places anything. And it is representative rather than lucky,
 * measured rather than argued: swept over each such view's WHOLE padded range,
 * the answer is uniform — every element roll takes every padded row, every leaf
 * roll takes none. `every view answering no refuses its whole padded range` is
 * pinned in `placement-admissibility.test.ts` so a row that disagrees is a
 * failure rather than a surprise.
 *
 * ⚠ ASKING THE OP ALSO CORRECTS THREE ROLLS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION, and they
 * are the path rule's error, not the unheld row's — measured by removing the
 * row and watching them stay caught. `<~ [~@3.5 d2@2 c#2@2.5]>` and two like it
 * are element-path rolls, so the path rule called them placeable; they refuse
 * all 267 / 84 / 96 placements over their full padded range, and every one of
 * those was being offered.
 *
 * ⚠ Distinct from writer REACH, which asks "can this view write back?" — a
 * question every leaf view answers yes to, and the axis #986 raised (grid
 * 80→131, roll 56→85). Those figures are true and unaffected; acceptance of new
 * content is a different axis.
 *
 * COST, measured over the corpus per view: grid p50 0.002ms / p99 0.55ms /
 * worst 6.7ms, roll p50 0.004ms / p99 1.0ms / worst 5.7ms — against the grid's
 * own per-cell `placeable` map at p99 2.25ms / worst 13.1ms, which the panel
 * already pays. It stops at the first placement taken, so every view that
 * places anything answers in a cell or two and only a surface refusing
 * everything is scanned in full — which is the surface whose answer needs the
 * whole scan. Both panels memoize it on the model, because `mutate` fires on
 * every pointermove of a drag.
 *
 * And the memo is not the only thing standing between the full scan and a
 * per-frame cost, which is worth saying because the memo alone would not be
 * enough — a drag makes a new model every frame. The view that pays the whole
 * scan is one that refuses everything, and on the roll that is a leaf view,
 * which no drag can change: 0 of 54 leaf rolls accept a velocity edit at all,
 * against 395 of 491 elsewhere. The expensive answer and the draggable surface
 * are disjoint populations, measured rather than hoped.

 * `resizeNote`'s half of the pair on the grid, and the gesture #1053 asks for.
 *
 * WHY THE GRID GETS ONE AT ALL. The model has carried a cell's length since #1010 P4b,
 * the printer has preserved it since P4c, and #1056 put it on screen. Length was the one
 * axis the panel could show and could not set, so the only way to shorten a note was to
 * leave the view and edit the code — which is the gap the whole code↔view line exists to
 * close.
 *
 * THE CAP IS `partRoom`, not the lane's own room; see its note for why the two differ and
 * why the drawing legitimately uses the looser one.
 *
 * FLOORS AT ONE COLUMN, exactly as `resizeNote` does, and for a sharper reason here: the
 * grid writes one token per column and a sustain as `_`, so a length below one column has
 * no spelling at this resolution at all (`sustainTokens` declines it). Flooring is not a
 * policy choice about small notes; it is the shortest thing the writer can say.
 *
 * DECLINES BY RETURNING ITS INPUT, so `canResizeCell` is the op rather than a second
 * predicate beside it ([[PV241]]). Three populations decline, and all three are correct:
 *  - a sustain with NO REST IN REACH to write itself into. The writer will absorb the
 *    rests a lengthened note runs over, taking bytes that said "nothing starts here"
 *    (#1146) — but where every column in reach carries a note there is nothing to take,
 *    and `bd*4` cannot grow at all.
 *  - a length that would sustain under ANOTHER sound in the same `,`-part. `partRoom`
 *    caps rather than declines here, so this only bites where the cap cannot help.
 *  - an edit the DOCUMENT would not record — see the byte comparison below.
 *
 * MEASURED OVER THE 966-UNIT GRID CORPUS: 1016 of 4729 notes are offered a handle (552
 * can grow, 464 can only shorten), spread over 240 units. Every one produces writable
 * notation and a document that actually changes — asserted in `op-admissibility.test.ts`,
 * which is also where the 571 dead offers this op used to make are recorded.
 *
 * ⚠ Those figures were 854 / 390 / 178 before #1146, and the gap was entirely the
 * neighbouring-bytes decline: on FLAT grids the handle reached 46 of 732 units and now
 * reaches 105.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ NOW 1273 OF 5251, AND THE RISE IS A DEFECT BEING REMOVED RATHER THAN REACH BEING
 * ADDED (#1235). The identity below is what made that defect invisible: the leaf writer
 * compared TOKENS only, so it answered a resize with the source bytes unchanged, and this
 * function dutifully reported "the document did not move" and withdrew the handle. 270
 * handles were dark that way — every one on a model carrying leaf spans — and nothing
 * anywhere reported a problem, because from here a swallowed write and an inexpressible
 * length are the same observation. The writer refuses the length now and the element
 * writer answers it. (The denominator moved 4729 → 5251 with the corpus, not with this.)

/**
 * WHICH NOTES A RESIZE HANDLE WOULD DO SOMETHING TO (#1322).
 *
 * The panel draws a length handle on every note's tail. Since #1318 gave resize the
 * ability to decline, some of those handles take the cursor, accept the drag, and write
 * nothing — a control that promises an edit that cannot happen. This is the set the panel
 * gates on, and it belongs here rather than beside the render for the same reason
 * `canResizeCell` does: the admissibility of a gesture is the writer's answer, and a
 * predicate written next to the view is a second oracle that drifts the moment the
 * writer's reach moves.
 *
 * ⚠ IT CANNOT BE BUILT FROM `canResizeNote`, which is the obvious thing to reach for and
 * is wrong here. That predicate is `resizeNote(...) !== model` — IDENTITY — so it answers
 * "did the writer accept the ask", not "did the document change". Asked for the length a
 * note already has, `resizeNote` rebuilds an equal model in 5,440 of 5,480 corpus notes
 * and the bytes differ in NONE of them, so an offer-set built on it counts no-ops as
 * affordances. Measured: `canResizeNote` over `{1,2,4}` keeps a dead handle on 1,768
 * notes, and over `d±1` on 1,726. Scored on BYTES the same `d±1` shape is exact.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GRID DOES NOT MEET THIS because its rule only ever asks `d+1` and `d-1`, which
 * are never no-ops. What does not port is the KEY: `SequencerGrid` collects a
 * `Set<number>` of start columns, sound because a lane cannot hold two notes at one step.
 * A roll comma-stack can — `[d4,f4,d4]` — so `(pitch, start)` is not an identity here and
 * keying on it silently merged 5 of 3,619 offerable notes. The set is keyed by NOTE
 * OBJECT, which is what `overlapAt` hands the render back.
 *
 * WHY `d±1` IS EXACT rather than a lucky proxy: `resizeNote` floors the new duration at 1
 * and caps it at a maximum, so the writable lengths form one contiguous run around the
 * note's own. If any longer length writes, `d+1` writes; if any shorter one does, `d-1`
 * does. Checked against an exhaustive sweep of every column the drag can reach — 1,861
 * inert of 5,480, with 0 notes classified differently by the two.
 *
 * ⚠ `Math.max(1, d - 1)`, not `d - 1` behind a `< 1` guard. Where `1 < d < 2` the shrink
 * ask is a fraction below 1, and guarding it away loses a real shrink the writer would
 * take — `d2@29.5+1.5` shrinking to 1. It changes exactly ONE note of 5,480.
 *
 * ⚠ AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT SAID SIX, AND SAID "sub-1 note (`@0.5`)". Both
 * wrong, from the same mistake: the six came from subtracting two counts that differed
 * for TWO reasons — this ask (1) and a `(pitch, start)` key collision (5) — and the
 * mechanism was guessed rather than measured. There are ZERO sub-1 duration notes in the
 * population, so the case the comment described does not occur at all. Split a difference
 * by cause before attributing it.
 *
 * COST, because this hangs off the model and `mutate` fires per `pointermove`, so it is
 * paid per accepted FRAME of a drag, not once per gesture — the axis #1324 was reverted
 * on. Over the 595 corpus units: p50 0.05ms, p90 0.45ms, p99 3.61ms, worst 15.88ms on a
 * 144-note × 64-column model. That sits in the envelope of the grid's own `placeable`
 * memo (p99 2.54ms, worst 14.4ms), which shipped, and well inside the roll's per-CELL map
 * (p99 21.67ms, worst 50ms), which #1072 declined. It asks once per NOTE, which is why —
 * the declined map asked once per empty cell.

 * the PREVIOUS frame's result would re-derive its own clamp against a note it had already

 * dragging back does not restore it. The panel already knew this and rebuilt from a fixed

 * consolidation instead of being re-discovered.
 *
 * ⚠ SINGULAR, AND DELIBERATELY NOT `removeNote`'S PLURAL CELL. `(start, pitch)` is not an
 * identity — a comma-stack can hold the same pitch twice at one start. Delete addresses
 * the whole cell (#1321), and it is worth saying why move does not follow it: delete's
 * inline filter matched on `(pitch, start)` BY VALUE, so that gesture was already plural
 * and the ruling only wrote down what shipped. Move's inline build excluded the grabbed
 * note BY REFERENCE — it is shipped SINGULAR, and the precedent was never move's.
 *
 * Measured, the difference is not academic — 6,529 of 982,157 pointer-reachable asks land
 * on a cell with a twin, and taking both changes the answer on every one of them.
 * ⚠ An earlier reading put that cost far higher (10,290 answers, 1,176 refusals) because
 * the sweep grabbed each note BY INDEX, including second twins no pointer can grab. Asks
 * the panel cannot make are not evidence about the panel.
 *
 * And move is the one gesture that can UN-STACK a twin: relocate the note the view shows
 * and the two become individually addressable, where taking both keeps them stacked and
 * unreachable for good. So the singular reading serves the identity problem better here
 * than the plural one does — the opposite of how it falls out for delete.
 *
 * The note is addressed by INDEX into the base, which is sound precisely because `base` is
 * captured ONCE per gesture: the index cannot drift under a re-parse the way it would if
 * this took `prev`. First-at-cell is the note `overlapAt` returns, i.e. the one drawn.
 *
 * ⚠ IT CARRIES `gain`, WHICH THE INLINE BUILD COULD NOT. The panel constructed
 * `{ pitch, start, duration }` literally, and a literal cannot carry a field it does not
 * name — so a drag would reset the note's velocity and write that as a second edit riding
 * on the first. Spreading the grabbed note keeps whatever the model holds.
 * ⚠ NO CORPUS UNIT WITNESSES THIS: 0 of 988,686 asks grab a note with a non-neutral gain,
 * so it is fixed by construction and NOT on evidence. Said plainly because the rest of
 * this comment is measured and this part is not.
 *
 * DECLINES BY RETURNING ITS INPUT, which is what this op family means by "could not
 * apply". Two cases decline: nothing at the grabbed cell, and a result the document
 * cannot spell.
 *
 * ⚠ A DROP WHERE THE NOTE ALREADY IS IS NOT A DECLINE, and the distinction is the whole
 * reason to say so here. Mid-drag the document sits at the last accepted position, not at
 * the base — so "declined" has to mean LEAVE IT ALONE, while dropping the note back on its
 * own cell has to mean GO HOME. Both would return the base model, and the caller cannot
 * tell them apart from the return value. Rebuilding the base's own content for a self-drop
 * keeps the two answers distinguishable by identity: a refusal is the input, a restore is
 * an equal-but-new model the caller writes.

  // are all grid RESCALES, only 31 of the anchored path's are. Spelling is not fidelity.
  //
  // The check that would make anchoring safe is a READBACK, and move fires on every
  // pointermove — the same cadence that made #1324's readback unshippable at p99 549ms.
  // So the locality fix belongs at the boundary where ONE parse per GESTURE is affordable,
  // not here. Until then this writes the way the panel always did, and what it adds is the
  // refusal the panel could never make.
