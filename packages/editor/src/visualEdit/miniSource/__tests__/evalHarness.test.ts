/**
 * The harness's own gates (#1008).
 *
 * The measurement that produced this phase's predecessor passed while 148 of
 * 150 documents failed to evaluate: its only assertion was on the document
 * count, which held. An assertion on a run's SHAPE says nothing about its
 * coverage, so every mechanism that buys coverage here is proved load-bearing
 * by BREAKING it — never by reading it.
 *
 * Each test below is a red-test in both directions: it asserts the document
 * evaluates with the mechanism, and fails without it. If a future change makes
 * a mechanism unnecessary, the "without" half starts passing and says so.
