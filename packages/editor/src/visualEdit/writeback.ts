/**
 * writeback — chunk → document.
 *
 * The mutation half of the visual-editing spine. Visual panels read a
 * `ChunkInfo` (see `chunkDetect.ts`) to learn the doc offsets they may edit,
 * then route every edit through here so it is:
 *
 *  1. **Surgical** — only the named offset range changes; the rest of the
 *     statement (mini-notation quotes, spacing, indent) stays byte-identical.
 *     This is the whole reason write-back panels edit TEXT and not the IR:
 *     `toStrudel` is a whole-statement canonical regenerator that would
 *     reformat the leaf layer (design doc Appendix A).
 *  2. **Origin-tagged** — while a panel edit is applied, `currentSource` names
 *     it, so the host's `onDidChangeModelContent` listener can tell a panel
 *     edit (re-eval audio, keep panel model) from a typed edit (re-parse the
 *     panel model). Monaco's content-change event carries no source of its
 *     own, so the flag is set synchronously around the edit — the listener
 *     fires inside `pushEditOperations`, while the flag is up.
 *  3. **One undo step** — every call is a single `pushEditOperations`, so even
 *     a multi-cell drag (`replaceRanges`) is one Ctrl-Z.
 *
 * Range discipline: offsets come from a `ChunkInfo` and are valid ONLY against
 * the exact doc it was detected from. Use `applyFresh` (or call `isChunkFresh`
 * yourself) before every write — stale offsets corrupt unrelated code.
 *
 * The pure helpers (`formatNumber`, `normalizeEdits`) are string/number math
 * with no Monaco dependency, so they unit-test with plain assertions. The
 * `Writeback` class is the thin Monaco-bound shell, observed in the app.
