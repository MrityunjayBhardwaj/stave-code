/**
 * surfaceRoute + the cross-statement freshness guard (#1240).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS: TWO BREAKS THAT REDDENED NOTHING ────────────────
 * The #1240 break matrix ran five cells. Three reddened app gates. Two did not,
 * and a break that reddens nothing is a claim about the BREAK before it is a
 * claim about the tests — so both were checked for liveness first, and both are
 * live code on a reachable path:
 *
 *   B3 — deleting the `miniAnchor` half of `isChunkFresh` changed no verdict
 *        anywhere. That is the guard standing between a resolver-supplied span
 *        and a write into an unrelated declaration: the most safety-critical
 *        line in the change, and nothing exercised it.
 *
 *   B5 — deleting `chunkSurface`'s `miniVia === 'resolver'` scoping changed no
 *        verdict either, because the only OTHER caller of the rule — the
 *        coverage harness — carries its own copy of that condition, and
 *        `chunkSurface` itself is reached only by `PatternPanel`, which no
 *        vitest arm mounts. The rule was tested; the call site was not
 *        ([[P540]]: arms over an extracted unit are structurally blind to
 *        whether production reaches it).
 *
 * Each arm below was red-tested against the break that motivated it, and the
 * two breaks redden DISJOINT arms — B3 reddens only the freshness describe, B5
 * only the scoping one. Distinct is not disjoint ([[P558]]), so that separation
 * is checked rather than assumed.
