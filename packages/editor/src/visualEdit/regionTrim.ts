/**
 * regionTrim.ts — the WRITE DECISIONS for a sample's played region (#1527).
 *
 * `begin` and `end` say which slice of a sample file a mark plays. The timeline
 * already DRAWS that slice (#1512, `waveformLane.ts`); this is the other
 * direction — a dragged mark edge becoming `.begin(0.25)` in the document.
 *
 * Pure, like `mixer/writeStrip.ts` and for the same reason: `ChunkInfo` + a
 * target value → one surgical edit, or `null` when the control must hand off.
 * The gesture is then unit-testable without a canvas or Monaco.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS ITS OWN MODULE AND NOT AN ADD-EFFECT ENTRY ──────────────────
 * `effectCatalog.ts` excludes `begin`/`end` deliberately, and says why:
 * "sample trim (a sample/region concern)". That division of labour is right —
 * the FX menu is per-track colour, and a region is a property of the audio a
 * mark plays. This module is the surface those two were being reserved for, so
 * the fence stays up rather than being routed around.
 *
 * ── WHAT IT REFUSES, AND HOW OFTEN THAT IS ──────────────────────────────────
 * Measured over the 558-document archive (deduped by sha256 of `code`): of the
 * region controls that a chunk actually exposes, **8 of 16 `.begin` and 6 of 17
 * `.end` are numeric** — the rest are patterned (`"<0 .25 .5 .75>"`), computed
 * (`rand.rangex(0.1,.5)`) or bound (`beginVal`). Roughly half must be refused,
 * so refusing is a first-class outcome here rather than an edge case.
 *
 * The common case is neither: **544 of those 558 documents write no `.begin` at
 * all**, so the path that runs most is the append.
