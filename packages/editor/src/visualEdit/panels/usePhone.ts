/**
 * Is this a PHONE (#1990)? Two things, both asked of the browser:
 *
 *   - its main pointer is a finger (`(pointer: coarse)`) — so a narrow desktop window is
 *     still a desktop, and a laptop with a touch screen still has a mouse;
 *   - the SHORT side of its screen is under 600 px — the line phones and tablets fall
 *     either side of (a phone is 320–430 across, the smallest tablets 600 and up).
 *
 * The SCREEN is measured, not the window: turning a phone sideways makes its window
 * 800-odd px wide, and an on-screen keyboard makes a tablet's window short, and neither
 * changes what the device is.
 *
 * A tablet is not a phone here: it keeps the desktop's layout.
