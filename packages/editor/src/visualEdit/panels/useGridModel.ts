/**
 * useGridModel — model-in-state binding shared by the grid panels (Sequencer,
 * Piano Roll).
 *
 * Both panels parse the chunk's mini-notation into a structured model, edit it,
 * and write the serialized result back over the mini range. The model is held
 * in component state rather than derived per-render so structure the user
 * clears (an emptied lane, a deleted note) survives — its serialized form may
 * omit it, but the editable scaffold stays. The model is reseeded only on
 * EXTERNAL edits, detected by comparing what we'd serialize against the
 * incoming source; the panel's own write-back echoes leave it untouched.
 *
 * `mutate(fn)` runs a pure transform against the latest model (synchronous, so
 * a fast drag reads its own prior edits), then writes the serialized result.
 * A transform whose serialization is inexpressible in the subset (serialize →
 * null) is dropped, leaving the document untouched.
 *
 * VELOCITY (the second write-back range): a panel may also carry a `.gain("…")`
 * mini that runs PARALLEL to the head mini — per-column velocity (#409). When
 * `serializeGain`/`applyGain` are supplied, every `mutate` writes the mini AND
 * the coordinated gain edit (replace an existing string `.gain` arg, insert
 * `.gain("…")` after the expression, or remove our `.gain` when all-neutral) as
 * ONE `commit` — a single undo step. The model is reseeded when EITHER
 * the mini OR the `.gain` changes externally. WHICH BYTES that write changes is
 * not decided here: `gridWriteEdits` (`codeView/notation/gainEdit`, #1887) builds
 * the edit list and this hook hands it to `commit` (#1909).
 *
 * Nor are keep-or-reseed and the write plan: `reconcileGrid` and `gridWritePlan`
 * (`codeView/notation/gridCodec`, #1942) answer both. This hook holds the state,
 * the refs, the gesture and the `commit` call.
 *
 * Built on `useActiveChunk` (the active-editor → chunk layer).
