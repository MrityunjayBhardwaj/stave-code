/**
 * Sequencer — drum/step grid (#382, per-column velocity #409).
 *
 * Parses the mini-notation of the `s(...)` / `sound(...)` statement under the
 * cursor into a `StepGridModel` and renders lanes × steps. Toggling a cell
 * re-serializes the model and writes it back over the mini-notation range
 * (`'seq'`); a drag paints multiple cells as ONE undo step. Anything outside
 * the editable grid subset (`{}`, `/`, …) → standby, code-only — the
 * conservatism rule.
 *
 * Length: a note is drawn across the columns it covers (#1056) and its trailing
 * edge carries a handle that sets how long it sounds, in whole columns (#1053) —
 * the roll's gesture on the other surface. The handle is drawn only where the
 * writer would take the drag, so it never promises an edit the document refuses.
 *
 * Velocity: an ON cell shows its level as a bottom-anchored fill; dragging it
 * vertically sets the column's gain (DAW velocity-lane behaviour — drag down to
 * soften). The level is written to a parallel `.gain("…")` mini aligned to the
 * serialized columns; when every column returns to neutral the `.gain` is
 * removed. Gain is single-part / single-bar only; richer shapes keep toggling
 * but the `.gain` is left untouched.
 *
 * The model lives in component state, not derived per-render from the chunk, so
 * a lane the user clears completely keeps its row. The model is reseeded only
 * on EXTERNAL edits — see `useGridModel`.
