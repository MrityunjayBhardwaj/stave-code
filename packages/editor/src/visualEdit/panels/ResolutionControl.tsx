/**
 * ResolutionControl — the "Slots" grid-resolution control shared by both grids
 * (#479, reshaped by #1059).
 *
 *     Slots   ÷2   [ 16 ]   ×2
 *                    ▲ double-click → 4 / 8 / 16 / 32 / 64
 *
 * ── WHY RELATIVE STEPS AND NOT ABSOLUTE PRESETS ───────────────────────────────
 * `RESOLUTION_PRESETS` are absolute counts — the right vocabulary for a document
 * op ("make this pattern 16 elements"), the wrong one for a VIEW derived from the
 * pattern's own resolution. A 3-element pattern's clean finer views are 6, 12, 24
 * and none of them is a preset, so under absolutes every offer it gets is a
 * rewrite. Measured over the corpus (#1059): 334 grid offers / 219 roll offers
 * still wrote the file for that reason alone, and a ×k vocabulary converts every
 * one of them — grid 96 of 96 units, roll 64 of 64, none stranded.
 *
 * `freeZoneScale` never needed changing for this: its only shape test is
 * `target % docSteps`, so it already admits any whole multiple. The picker was the
 * one layer still speaking absolutes.
 *
 * ── GROUNDED IN THE DAW STANDARD, NOT INFERRED ────────────────────────────────
 * This is Ableton's model. Live drives its grid with *Narrow Grid* (Cmd-1), which
 * doubles grid density, and *Widen Grid* (Cmd-2), which halves it — relative
 * stepping is the primary interaction, and the absolute value stays on screen as a
 * readout rather than as the thing you click. Logic likewise offers a Division
 * value (1/1 … 1/64) you can also pick directly. So: steps to move, readout to
 * know where you are, dropdown to jump.
 *
 * ⚠ THE READOUT IS A COUNT, NOT A NOTE VALUE, AND THAT IS A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE.
 * Every DAW labels this "1/16". That label asserts the cycle is a 4/4 bar, which
 * Strudel does not guarantee — `cps` is free and a pattern can be any length — so
 * "1/16" would be true only by coincidence. "16 slots" is what we can actually
 * warrant.
 *
 * ── THE TWO ZONES, AND WHERE THE LINE BETWEEN THEM ACTUALLY SITS ──────────────
 * Every target this control offers falls in one of two zones, and the boundary is
 * ONE number: the count the DOCUMENT itself spells (`documentSteps`, not `steps` —
 * `steps` is what is currently drawn, which may be a refined view of it).
 *
 *     target  >=  document count   →  FREE.   Nothing is written. The panel just
 *                                     draws the same notation more or less finely.
 *     target  <   document count   →  WRITES. This is an edit to the user's file.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ZONE IS NOT THE DIRECTION. The natural reading of a ÷2 / ×2 pair is "up is
 * a view, down is a rewrite", and it is wrong in the half nobody looks at. Coming
 * back DOWN through a refined view is free the whole way to the document — that is
 * exactly what makes refining reversible, and `freeZoneScale(D, D)` returns
 * `UNREFINED` by construction to say so. Only going below the document is an edit.
 *
 * So ÷2 is not one control with one meaning. Standing on a ×4 view of a 4-column
 * pattern, ÷2 is free; standing on the document itself, the same button is an edit
 * (and on the grid, a refused one). Which is why every button here ASKS `slotState`
 * for its own target rather than deriving anything from the arrow it is drawn with.
 *
 * Measured over every standing a user can occupy (#1059 — 3571 grid standings,
 * 1982 roll):
 *   - ×2 upward .................. 3420 free / 82 refused (leaf units, by design)
 *   - ÷2 staying >= document ..... 2613 grid / 1438 roll, ALL free — not one write
 *                                  leaks into the descent
 *   - ÷2 below the document ...... grid 546 of 546 REFUSED; roll 223 live writes
 *
 * That last asymmetry is the two surfaces disagreeing honestly, not a bug: the grid
 * preserves note length, and half a column has no spelling, so the writer declines
 * and the control says so. The roll carries a duration natively and can write it.
 * Whether the grid should offer anything there at all is #1061's product call.
 *
 * ── HOW A TARGET IS DRAWN ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every button asks `slotState` for the target it would apply — the SAME call the
 * grid runs on click, never a prediction of it. States:
 *   - `active`   — the current count (highlighted, not clickable);
 *   - `view`     — the free zone (#1057): a whole multiple of what the DOCUMENT
 *      spells, so the panel simply draws the same notation more finely and your
 *      file is not touched at all. Drawn normal, and the tooltip says so — a user
 *      deciding whether it is safe to press should not find out by pressing;
 *   - `lossless` — writes, but every hit keeps its position (haps identical);
 *   - `quantize` — writes, and notes snap to the nearest new slot, so timing moves;
 *   - `disabled` — not offered.
 *
 * ⚠ THE `~` CUE MEANS ONE THING: THIS IS ABOUT TO REWRITE YOUR FILE (#1059). It
 * used to mark `quantize` alone, i.e. "this changes your timing". Since Phase 4
 * refining never writes at all, the honest split is no longer straight-vs-quantized
 * but FREE-vs-WRITES — and `lossless` is on the writing side of it (2 live offers
 * on the roll, 0 on the grid). Cueing only `quantize` would leave a file-rewriting
 * button drawn exactly like a free one.
