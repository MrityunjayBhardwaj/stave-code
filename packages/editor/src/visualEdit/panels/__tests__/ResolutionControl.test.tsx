/**
 * ResolutionControl — the Slots control's own states, NAMED (#1059).
 *
 * #1059 asks for the control to be named explicitly in a gate rather than covered
 * incidentally by a corpus sweep, and it says why: the op-admissibility sweep once
 * read a clean zero while the largest dead-control population in the codebase sat
 * in the corpus it had just swept, because the one control the panel actually
 * drives was SKIPPED rather than failed. A sweep whose per-case coverage is
 * optional certifies nothing about the case it skipped.
 *
 * So this file asserts the control itself: what it renders, which target it asks
 * about, and which target it hands back on click.
 *
 * ── THE ONE THING THAT IS EASY TO GET WRONG HERE ──────────────────────────────
 * `steps` is what is DRAWN, so the relative targets are `steps × 2` and `steps ÷ 2`
 * — and the control must ASK `slotState` about exactly those, never decide for
 * itself whether they are free. Every assertion below therefore drives a stub
 * `slotState` and checks the target it was asked about, which is the only way to
 * see the difference between "the control asked the right question" and "the
 * control guessed the right answer" ([[P433]] — a check that reconstructs a
 * decision instead of reading it is wrong in the permissive direction).

 * because the new grid cannot spell anything shorter. `SlotState` carries neither —
 * it names the mechanism the op reaches for — so the control reads them off the
 * op's own report.
 *
 * Every case below drives an explicit effect table, because the point is not what
 * the ops compute (that is `resolution.test.ts`) but that the control SAYS what it
 * was told and does not infer a consequence from a state. A `quantize` whose onsets
