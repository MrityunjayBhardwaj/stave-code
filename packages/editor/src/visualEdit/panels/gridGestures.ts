/**
 * The grids' keys as commands (#1801).
 *
 * A panel's keys are commands you can see in Settings → Keyboard Shortcuts,
 * rebind, and run from the palette, and they answer only while that panel has
 * focus (#1795, #1797). The command registry lives in the app, which this
 * package cannot import, so the grids meet it through this module instead:
 *
 * - `GRID_GESTURES` names each gesture — its id, the grid it belongs to, and
 *   its default keys. The app registers exactly these, so the list in Settings
 *   and the keys the grids answer to come from one table.
 * - The host calls `setGridKeyMatcher` with its own matcher (the registry's
 *   `matchScopedCommand`), so a rebind made in Settings reaches the grid. With
 *   no host matcher — component tests, any other host — a grid matches the
 *   defaults below through the one chord builder, and keeps working.
 * - A mounted grid installs what its gestures do with `mountGridGestures`;
 *   `runGridGesture` runs one there, or dry-runs it to ask whether it applies
 *   now (the palette offers a gesture only when it does).
