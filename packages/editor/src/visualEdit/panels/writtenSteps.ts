/**
 * writtenSteps — where each step AS WRITTEN begins, in the columns a panel draws (#1841).
 *
 * `bd [~ bd] sd ~` is eight columns and four written steps. The grids drew every column
 * edge alike, so the four steps the text writes were invisible. This module adds no
 * reading of the pattern of its own: it re-expresses what the parser already recorded for
 * the writers — one region per top-level element, with the columns it owns
 * (`SourcePart.regions`, `AltSource.regions`) — in DRAWN columns, so a panel can draw a
 * line at each written step and a ruler that counts them. Pattern-grid epic #1832 is
 * visuals only: when the model says `hh*8` is one written step, it is drawn as one.
 *
 * Three spaces meet here, converted in one place each:
 *   part column  → shared column   `× part.factor` (`SourcePart.factor`, how the writers
 *                                  stretch a part onto the shared grid)
 *   bar column   → shared column   `b × perBar + from` (`AltSource`: single-cycle columns)
 *   shared       → drawn           `drawnAt` when the grid is drawn per bar (`perBar.ts`)
 *
 * A region set that no longer tiles the model (a Slots change moved the width out from
 * under it) is skipped, not guessed: that part draws bar and column lines only. It is the
 * same covers-check the writers use before they trust these spans. A leaf-read model
 * carries no written-step regions at all, and gets the same bar-and-column answer.
