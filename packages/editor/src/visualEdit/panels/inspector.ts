/**
 * inspector — the Pattern grids' selection key + the shared `.gain` (velocity)
 * write transforms.
 *
 * (Named for the former Mixer-as-inspector; the inspector panel was removed —
 * pitch/position/velocity are read straight off the grid — but the selection
 * KEY and the velocity transforms it shared with the grids live on. Selection
 * is now the ⌘/Ctrl-click copy/paste target (#528); the velocity transforms are
 * the grids' vertical-drag write path.)
 *
 * A "selected" cell is a lightweight key, not a reference, so it survives the
 * model reseed every write triggers:
 *   - roll: keyed by `pitch` token + `start` column;
 *   - step: keyed by `lane` index + `step` column.
 *
 * VELOCITY = `.gain` (grounded #427 Q1). `setGroupGain`/`setColumnGain` live
 * HERE so the grid drag writes the SAME `.gain` transform everywhere — one path,
 * no dual-representation drift (PV129).
