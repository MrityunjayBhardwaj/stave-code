/**
 * THE map between a control's value and its position on a dial (#1581).
 *
 * A control's value sits somewhere on its range: `gain` 0…1 is linear, `cutoff`
 * 20…20000 is logarithmic (an octave is a fixed distance, not a fixed number of
 * hertz), and a value a gesture writes is spelled on the control's own quantum
 * (`0.01`, `1 Hz`) rather than with whatever float the arithmetic left.
 *
 * Three rules, and this file is the ONLY place any of them is written. Two
 * surfaces turn pointer travel into a value with them — the mixer knob (`Knob`)
 * and the timeline's stepped automation lane (`steppedLane`, in the app package)
 * — and before this file they each spelled all three themselves. Four spellings
 * that agreed today is exactly the state that drifts apart silently: they already
 * differed on when a log map is safe, and the first change to either would have
 * made a step dragged on the lane land on a different number than the same
 * control turned on the knob.
 *
 * ⚠ NO IMPORTS, AND IT MUST STAY THAT WAY. The lane may not import the editor's
 * barrel at runtime — it drags a CommonJS dependency into the app's test loader
 * and the file fails to collect — so this module is published as its own entry
 * (`@stave/editor/knobScale`, the arrangement `@stave/editor/worker` already
 * uses). A dependency added here is a dependency added to that bundle.
 *
 * Pure — no React, no Monaco, no engine.

 * gesture start from a position the user cannot see.
 *
 * A log map needs a positive floor AND a positive value — `log(0)` is −∞, and a
 * frequency control a document sets to `0` widens its range down to `0`. Either
 * falls back to the linear map rather than drawing an infinity.
