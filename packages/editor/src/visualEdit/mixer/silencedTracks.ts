/**
 * silencedTracks — the cross-view "which tracks read as inactive" selector.
 *
 * A track is SILENCED when it's MUTED (the `_` marker) OR a solo is active
 * elsewhere and it isn't one of the soloed tracks — the exact rule the Mixer
 * dims a strip by (`LocalMixerStrip`: mute button + `dimmed = soloActive &&
 * !soloed.has(id)`), widened to include mute so the Song Timeline can express
 * BOTH as a lane fade (the Timeline has no mute button — dimming is its only
 * "inactive" affordance).
 *
 * It returns the silenced tracks' DISPLAY NAMES (`StripModel.name`) — the SAME
 * key the Song Timeline lanes by (`SceneLane.displayName`, both from the shared
 * `trackIdentity`), NOT the strip's `id` (which is `#k` for anonymous tracks and
 * would never match a lane's `d{N}` display key). Joining by display name is why
 * a mute in the Mixer fades the right lane and the two views can't disagree
 * (PV155).
 *
 * READ-ONLY: it OBSERVES solo via `useSoloedIds` (which, unlike `useSoloStrips`,
 * does NOT acquire the eval-source overlay), so a Timeline that merely reflects
 * solo can never keep the audio silencing alive. It re-derives the strip names
 * from the active document on every edit — the same pure `buildStripModels`
 * projection the Mixer renders (invariant V-mixer-1) — so a mute typed in code
 * and a solo clicked in the Mixer both light here without a shared store between
 * them.
