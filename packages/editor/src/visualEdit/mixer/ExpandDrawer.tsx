/**
 * ExpandDrawer — a strip's full knob chain, inline to the right (#550 / S4b).
 *
 * The Mixer console strip is the SUMMARY (dot/name/mute, pan/fader/meter/gain);
 * this drawer is the EFFECTS chain (quick-transforms + a Knob per numeric arg —
 * lpf, attack, crush, send levels, …). It mounts the shared `MixerBody`, the
 * very same body the Pattern-tab inspector uses, bound via an injected `applyEdit`
 * instead of the cursor: a channel passes `(m) => applyToStrip(strip.id, m)`, the
 * MASTER passes `applyToMasterChunk` (which adapts/materializes the `all()` line).
 * Either way every knob edit is a surgical, tagged, one-undo text change that goes
 * live while playing for free (centralised Writeback re-eval). The drawer holds no
 * document state itself — which strips are open is the console's ephemeral,
 * persisted UI state (`expandStore`), never the file (V-mixer-1).
 *
 * Two pieces of `MixerBody` are omitted because they're pattern-authoring
 * concerns, not mixing: the Snap picker (`division` left undefined) and the
 * sound-source picker (`showSoundPicker={false}`) — instrument/kit selection
 * lives on the Pattern tab inspector, its natural home.
