 * #1648 — the file name each stem gets, from the SAME names the mixer strips and
 * the Song timeline show (`buildStripModels` → `StripModel.name`).
 *
 * The engine keys a stem by `captureId` (`d1`, `drums`, `$0`, …). `$0` means
 * nothing to someone opening a folder of WAVs, so the name is the strip's, joined
 * on the captureId the strip already carries for its meter. A stem the strips
 * cannot name (no matching strip) falls back to its id, and the song-level stem
 * has its own name.
 *
 * Names are made safe for a file system and unique; each file is numbered in
 * document order so a folder sorts the way the song reads.
