/**
 * stripModel.ts — the channel-strip Mixer's read-model.
 *
 * A `StripModel` is one editable, addressable track projected from one detected
 * chunk: its name, source, gain, pan, sends — everything a strip shows. The
 * whole array is a PURE function of the document (`detectAllChunks` →
 * `buildStripModels`), with no React and no audio, so it unit-tests directly and
 * the strips are a trustworthy projection: close the Mixer, reopen it,
 * re-derive from text → identical (invariant V-mixer-1).
 *
 * S0 is read-only — the model carries the ranges every control will later write
 * to (S1 fader/pan, S3 mute, …), but builds nothing that needs a live engine.
 * The `captureId` join to the analyser map is a CANDIDATE here (the documented
 * numbering rule); it is verified against the engine in S2 (grounding gate GR1)
 * before any meter trusts it.
