/**
 * jumpCursorToTrack (#595) — the cursor-follows-strip guard.
 *
 * Verifies the once-per-target behaviour that keeps a continuous fader/knob drag
 * from thrashing the scroll/focus: reveal+focus only when the target statement
 * changed OR the editor isn't focused; otherwise leave the pinned caret alone.
 * Monaco-free — a tiny mock editor records which methods were called.
