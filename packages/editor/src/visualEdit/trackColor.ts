/**
 * trackColor — the SINGLE deterministic track-color algorithm, shared by the
 * Mixer console strips and the Song/musical Timeline (V-track-1, issue #579).
 *
 * Before this module each view coloured tracks its own way: the Timeline used
 * `paletteForTrack(trackIndexOf(laneKey), laneKey)` over a 32-cell palette
 * (`app/.../musicalTimeline/colors.ts`), while the Mixer used the drum-voice
 * palette (`stripModel.stripColor` → `sampleVoice`). Same track, two colours.
 *
 * The palette lived in the APP package, which the EDITOR cannot import
 * (`panels/noteColor.ts:13-15` — the editor barrel can't reach app code), which
 * is exactly why the two diverged. So the canonical algorithm lives HERE, in the
 * editor, where the Mixer can import it directly. The app's `colors.ts` keeps an
 * identical copy (it can't import the editor barrel either — that drags
 * `@strudel/draw → gifenc` into app unit tests and crashes them, P172), and a
 * drift-guard test deep-imports THIS module and asserts the two never diverge —
 * the same mirror-with-guard pattern as `laneKeyOf`/`resolveLaneKey`. One
 * algorithm, two provably-equal copies, neither importing the other at runtime.
 *
 * This file is PURE: no React, no audio, no IR, no heavy deps — so the Mixer can
 * import it freely and the drift-guard can deep-import it barrel-free.
 *
 * Keep this byte-for-byte equivalent (in OUTPUT) to `colors.ts` — the
 * drift-guard test (`musicalTimeline/__tests__/trackColor.drift.test.ts`) fails
 * loudly if they diverge.
