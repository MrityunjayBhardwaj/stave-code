/**
 * The page's ONE superdough graph, and who may borrow it for an offline render
 * (#1733).
 *
 * An offline render points superdough's module-level audio context and
 * controller at an `OfflineAudioContext` for as long as it runs
 * (`renderPatternOffline.ts`). Those globals are one per PAGE, not one per
 * engine: every file's runtime has its own `StrudelEngine`, and every one of
 * them, and every audition, reads the same two globals. So the rules that keep
 * a render honest live here, at page scope:
 *
 * ⚠ ONE OFFLINE RENDER AT A TIME, ACROSS ENGINES. `withOfflineGraph` queues
 * every render, a bounce or a background waveform render (#1731), behind the
 * one before it. Two engines each keep their own renders in order
 * (`renderStemsInOrder`, `trackEnvelopes.ts`) but cannot see each other's.
 *
 * ⚠ A LIVE SOUND FIRST, A BACKGROUND RENDER SECOND. An audition (the
 * instrument picker's ▶, a piano-roll key) calls `superdough()` directly, so
 * during a render it would play into the render: silent to the user, and drawn
 * into the waveform. `onLiveGraph` interrupts every background render, waits
 * for it to hand the globals back — at most one render window — and only then
 * plays. When nothing is rendering it plays at once, in the same call.
 *
 * ⚠ A USER'S RENDER BEFORE EVERY ENGINE'S BACKGROUND RENDER (#1735). A bounce
 * or a stems export in one file must not wait out another file's waveform
 * render: that is seconds per track on a long song. `withUserRender` stops the
 * background render in flight on EVERY engine and keeps them all from starting
 * one until it ends, not only its own engine's. A stems export is several
 * renders in a row, and a render that slipped in between two of them would
 * cost the same wait again.
 *
 * Not covered, on purpose: a USER's render (a bounce) is not interrupted by an
 * audition. The bounce is what the user asked for; an audition during one still
 * reaches the bounce's context, as it did before this module existed.
 *
 * Deliberately free of imports: the renders and interrupts arrive as functions.
