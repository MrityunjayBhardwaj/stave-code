/**
 * Convert a raw Strudel hap into an IREvent (NormalizedHap).

 * through so downstream consumers (DAW view, transform debugger) can
 * attribute every event to a producer.
 *
 * `irNodeLocLookup` is caller-supplied — engine threads the published
 * snapshot's loc map so each hap can be enriched with its `irNodeId`
 * by structural match (PV38 clause 2). Both optional — additive widening.
 *
 * `declaredLocations` (#1619) keeps only the spans the transpiler declared
 * (`declaredLocationKeys`). A string it never rewrote — a single-quoted argument,
 * `.color('sienna')` — is mini-parsed in its OWN quoted space, and that location
 * comes FIRST, so `loc[0]` read `[1, 7)`: the Song timeline put the track on another
 * track's lane, and the IR match below keyed on the same wrong span. Filtered before
 * the match, so every reader of `loc` sees one answer. Omitted → unchanged.
