 * Asking the browser to start audio (#1987).

 * A context made before the user has touched the page is born SUSPENDED, and ours is
 * made at boot. Nothing used to ask it to start: superdough's `initAudio` means to, but
 * its guard reads `(!audioCtx) instanceof OfflineAudioContext` (`superdough.mjs`,
 * `initAudio`), which is always false, so the `resume()` under it never runs. Desktop
 * browsers start a suspended context by themselves once the page has been clicked; a
 * phone browser that starts audio only when the page asks INSIDE a touch stays silent.
 *
 * So the page asks: on Play, inside the gesture (`startAudio`), and — for a Play that
 * lands before the engine has a context — on the next touch or key
 * (`startAudioOnNextGesture`).
