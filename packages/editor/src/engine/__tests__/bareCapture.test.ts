/**
 * bareCapture — the bare document's captureId, pinned against the rule that

 *
 * The point of these tests is NOT that `resolveBareCaptureId` returns `'$0'`.
 * Asserting that against a literal would pass just as happily if the mixer
 * renumbered its strips tomorrow, and the failure would then show up as a dead
 * meter nobody could trace. So the agreement is asserted against
 * `buildStripModels` itself — the function the mixer joins on — and a literal is
 * used only where it is the fact under test (the id's own value).
