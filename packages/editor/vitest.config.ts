     * An underscore-prefixed file is a PROBE, not a gate (#1113).
     *
     * This package sets no `include`, so it uses vitest's default, which collects
     * both `*.test.ts` and `*.spec.ts` anywhere under the package. That is why the
     * app package's convention does not transfer: over there `include` matches only
     * `*.test.ts`, so renaming a probe to `_name.spec.ts` makes it inert, and 19
     * files rely on that. Here a rename would change nothing — so the convention has
     * to be established rather than borrowed (#1111 is the app-side counterpart).
     *
     * What it costs to lack one: `_coverageDecomp.analysis.test.ts` says in its own
     * header that "the assertion is trivial so the run always passes". It contributed
     * a green that cannot mean anything, plus a console dump, to a gate suite.
     *
     * ⚠ `exclude` REPLACES vitest's defaults rather than extending them, so
     * `configDefaults.exclude` is spread first. Writing the bare array here would
     * silently start collecting `node_modules` and `dist`.
