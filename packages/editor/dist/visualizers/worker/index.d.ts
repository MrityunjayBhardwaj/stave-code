/**
 * hostVizWorker — the bundler-AGNOSTIC worker host that runs a viz sketch in a
 * `WorkerGlobalScope` and renders it to a transferred `OffscreenCanvas` (Phase B,
 * epic #228). Hosts BOTH renderer kinds, branching on `MountMessage.kind`:
 *   - `'p5'`    (B-3) — install the 6-part p5 DOM shim, compile via the shared
 *     `compileP5Code`, drive `redraw()` then BLIT p5's worker-local canvas onto the
 *     transferred presenting canvas (p5 makes its OWN canvases — Tier 2).
 *   - `'hydra'` (B-5) — install the 2-part hydra shim, `new Hydra({ canvas })` on
 *     the transferred canvas DIRECTLY (Tier 1: hydra accepts a canvas → no blit),
 *     feed `s.a.fft[]` from the frame's master bytes, drive `hydra.tick()`.
 *
 * The app's `viz-worker.ts` (bundled by Next via `new Worker(new URL(...))`) is a
 * two-line shell: `hostVizWorker(self)`. ONE worker hosts ONE kind (B-3/B-5; a
 * pool that reuses a worker across kinds is B-6) — so only one shim ever installs.
 *
 * SHARED per frame (both kinds) — `applyAndDraw`: `feed.applyFrame` owns the ONE
 * bus tick (PK22) + refresh the raw shims, then the kind-specific `draw()` runs
 * EXACTLY ONCE (1:1 with the main sampler's frame → cadence can't drift). After
 * the first successful draw the host posts a one-shot `ready` (B-5 / #247): the
 * main `FallbackVizRenderer` waits for it; a throw or timeout BEFORE it falls the
 * renderer back to the main thread (a worker that throws/hangs at startup = blank).
 *
 * CADENCE (PK22): the p5 setup is wrapped to `noLoop()` (we drive `redraw()`); the
 * hydra instance is `autoLoop:false` (we drive `tick()`). `staveUniforms.__tick`
 * is a no-op in the worker (built without `onTick`) — the feed already ticked.
 *
 * REF: PV70 (.anvi/vyapti.md), PK22 (.anvi/krama.md), dom-shim.ts, rawShims.ts,
 *      workerBusFeed.ts, signalTransport.ts, p5Compiler.ts, hydraCompiler.ts,
 *      hydraStaveBag.ts (the shared bag builder), HydraVizRenderer (main contract).
