/**
 * p6-cap-census.mjs — take the P6 blocker reading at a roll cap this tree does not ship,
 * and stamp it with an expiry (#1046).
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `ROLL-CAP-SWEEP.md` and `WRITER-CENSUS.md` both report what the roll's
 * period cap does to the number #1012 is scoped against. Three of those four rows fall
 * out of an ordinary census run and are now GENERATED into both documents. The fourth
 * does not: the cap is a module constant on purpose, so reading the census at 12 means
 * rewriting `parse.ts` and running again, which no gate can do. That row was therefore
 * the only one with nothing at all behind it, and it is the row the whole phase is
 * scoped against — it has been quoted as 34, then 39, then 34 again across three
 * documents and one test comment, all of them stale.
 *
 * WHY IT EDITS THE SOURCE. Same reason `roll-cap-sweep.mjs` does. The cap is a shipped
 * bound, not a knob; threading a parameter through the writer so a sweep could vary it
 * would measure a code path production never takes, which is the failure mode that put a
 * wrong cap in the tree to begin with. So it sets the constant to exactly the value a
 * ship would set it to, runs the real census, and puts the file back.
 *
 * WHY IT DERIVES NOTHING. It reads the `p6` block the census writes into
 * `WRITER-CENSUS.json` and copies it. A driver that re-implemented the columns in JS so
 * it could sweep them would be a second oracle over the same question ([[P519]]), and
 * would be free to agree with itself while both were wrong.
 *
 * WHY IT RUNS THE SHIPPED CAP TOO. The candidate reading cannot be re-taken by any gate,
 * so it is recorded next to the SAME RUN's reading at the shipped cap — which every gate
 * re-takes for free. `assertObservationCurrent` compares the two, and a corpus rebuild,
 * an admission change or a writer fix then reddens the census with "re-run this script"
 * instead of leaving a stale number in Markdown.
 *
 * WHY THE CONTROL ROW. Run 1 is deliberately unmutated. Without it, "the mutation applied
 * and the columns did not move" and "the mutation never applied" print identically, which
 * has produced four clean-looking rows off an unbroken tree before ([[P584]]). Every row
 * prints `applied=YES/NO` taken from `git status --porcelain` after the write and before
 * the run, and the cap each run actually used is read back out of the emitted artifact
 * rather than assumed from what was written.
