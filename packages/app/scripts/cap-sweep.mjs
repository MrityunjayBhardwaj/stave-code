/**
 * cap-sweep.mjs — drive a cap sweep across candidate values of one field of
 * `LEAF_PROJECT_BARS`, then diff the emitted rows PER ASK (#1020; grid arm #1041).
 *
 * WHY IT EDITS THE SOURCE. The cap is a module constant on purpose — it is a shipped
 * bound, not a knob. Threading a parameter through `projectPianoRollByLeaf` so a sweep
 * could vary it would mean the sweep measures a code path production never takes, which
 * is the failure mode that put a wrong cap in the tree in the first place. So the sweep
 * sets the constant to exactly the value a ship would set it to, runs the real writers,
 * and puts the file back. The file is restored in a `finally`, and the script refuses to
 * start if the working tree already has changes to it.
 *
 * WHY IT DIFFS PER ASK. "The change is additive" is a claim about individual asks. Two
 * totals cannot check it: an ask lost and an ask gained net to zero and read as "no
 * change" ([[PV233]]). So every run emits one row per ask and the diff walks them by
 * (population, mini).
 *
 * WHY EACH POPULATION IS REPORTED ALONE. `writer-reach`'s population is defined as
 * `if (core.ok) continue` — the complement of the census's. A cap figure that mixes them
 * is a number about no population at all, and the null result that set this cap to 4 came
 * from reading one population's answer as general ([[P345]]).
 *
 *   node scripts/cap-sweep.mjs 4 6 8 12          # the roll (the default)

/**
 * The two halves of `LEAF_PROJECT_BARS`, each with the regex that rewrites ITS field only.
 *
 * ⚠ The capture groups matter: group 2 is always the swept surface's value, and the other
 * surface's digits sit inside group 1 or 3 so they are copied through untouched. A single
 * regex with one `\d+` for both fields would rewrite whichever came first and the run would
 * be labelled for a cap it did not set — which is the class of error the gate's
 * read-the-cap-back-out-of-the-refusal-sentence discipline exists to catch.
 *
 * ⚠ This file drives BOTH surfaces. The grid arm was added at #1041 and it kept the
 * roll's name until #1279, when it was renamed and both committed observations were
 * re-taken so the command each one records stays runnable verbatim.
 *
 * The roll remains the DEFAULT — `cap-sweep.mjs 4 6 8 12`, with no surface word, sweeps
 * it — so the grid names itself and the roll does not. That asymmetry is in the
 * recorded commands too, which is why they are not interchangeable.
