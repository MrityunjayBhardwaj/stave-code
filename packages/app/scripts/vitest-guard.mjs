/**
 * vitest-guard — run vitest, raise the worker heap ceiling, and make a
 * MEMORY DEATH legible rather than indistinguishable from a regression (#1379).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The app suite intermittently stopped mid-run with no failing test and a
 * nonzero exit. That signature is identical to a real regression, and it cost
 * hours: the same death was attributed first to the environment, then to a
 * production diff, and neither was right. A suite's exit code cannot carry the
 * distinction between "your change broke something" and "the runner died", so
 * this wrapper carries it instead.
 *
 * ── THE TWO DEATHS, WHICH LOOK DIFFERENT ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Both were observed, and a guard that catches only one is a guard that lies:
 *
 *   1. The WORKER hits its heap limit. vitest survives, reports
 *      `ERR_WORKER_OUT_OF_MEMORY` as an unhandled error, and exits 1 with NO
 *      signal — so process-level signal detection never fires. Only the output
 *      names it.
 *   2. The PROCESS aborts. macOS records `Abort trap: 6` and the crash report
 *      names it exactly: `node::OOMErrorHandler` → `Heap::FatalProcessOutOfMemory`
 *      → `CheckIneffectiveMarkCompact`. Here there IS a signal and no marker in
 *      the output, because the process never got to print one.
 *
 * ── THE HEAP CEILING ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * vitest 1.6's `ThreadsOptions` does not expose `resourceLimits`, and a worker
 * thread REJECTS `--max-old-space-size` in `execArgv`
 * (`ERR_WORKER_INVALID_EXEC_ARGV`), so `vitest.config.ts` cannot set this.
 * `NODE_OPTIONS` on the parent does work — measured, 4288 MB → 8384 MB inside a
 * worker — because worker threads inherit it as their default resource limit.
 *
 * Why raising it is a fix and not a postponement: no single test file needs
 * anything close to the limit (heaviest measured alone: 893 MB). The exhaustion
 * comes from ACCUMULATION across the ~10 files each worker handles, which is
 * BOUNDED by files-per-worker. The ceiling was simply set slightly too low for
 * the suite's real shape.
 *
 * ⚠ Lowering `maxThreads` would make this WORSE: fewer workers means more files
 * each, and files-per-worker is precisely the quantity that accumulates.
 *
 * ⚠ Running `vitest` directly bypasses this wrapper and keeps the 4288 MB
 * default — which is the configuration the failure was observed on.
 *
 * A caller's own `--max-old-space-size` is respected, so the abort path stays
 * testable with a deliberately small heap.
