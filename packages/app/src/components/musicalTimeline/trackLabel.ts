/**
 * trackLabel — resolve a Song-timeline lane's DISPLAY name from the source label
 * (V-track-1, #579 STEP 2).
 *
 * The live engine keys every track positionally as `d{N}` (the hap `trackId`),
 * dropping the JS label — so a named `bass:` track shows `d1` in the Timeline
 * while the Mixer shows `bass` (the divergence the user reported). STEP 2 closes
 * it: read the label back from the source at the track's OWN `dollarPos` — the
 * `$:`/`bass:` statement offset the engine already stamps on every event
 * (`IREvent.dollarPos`) — so a NAMED track displays its label (and colours by
 * it) while an ANONYMOUS `$:` keeps `d{N}`.
 *
 * Using each lane's OWN `dollarPos` (engine provenance) avoids re-deriving a
 * parallel `d{N}` numbering from the source — the assumption that broke this
 * design TWICE (the engine excludes config lines and counts `_`-muted tracks in
 * ways a naive source parse gets wrong). Each lane resolves independently: no
 * ordering, no off-by-one. Verified live (#579): for `bass:/$:/d3:/$:/lead:/$:`
 * the lanes' dollarPos point exactly at `bass:`, `$:`, `d3:`, `$:`, `lead:`, `$:`.
 *
 * Anonymous-stays-`d{N}` is deliberate friction: a descriptive name requires an
 * explicit `name:` label — the tool never auto-writes one for display
 * (no-auto-naming principle, #579). The display resolves a label when present;
 * it never creates one.
 *
 * Reading the label is the editor's (`labelAtOffset`, since #1921 — the one rule
 * for what a name is, shared with section names, the Mixer and the rename
 * validators). This file keeps only the display fallback.

 * progression, or `code` not yet available) → keep `laneKey`.
 *
 * The lane's IDENTITY stays `laneKey` (`d{N}`) for the live hap-overlay match —
 * only the display name (and the colour derived from it) resolves to the label.
