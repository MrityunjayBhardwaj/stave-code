/**
 * The geometry of a STEPPED automation on a lane (#1463 Stage 2).
 *
 * A stepped parameter holds one value per cycle and repeats with a period
 * (`steppedAutomations`, editor). Drawing it is not a curve sample: it is a
 * staircase of flat segments, one per run of cycles that play the same step. This
 * module turns an automation plus the visible cycle span into those segments, a
 * value into a height and a pointer's travel back into a value (#1578), and a
 * press into the step it names. The canvas calls live in `drawTimeline`; the
 * gestures that use this geometry live in `FullSongTimeline`.
 *
 * ⚠ A SEGMENT IS ONE STEP, NOT ONE VALUE. Two adjacent steps that happen to hold
 * the same number (`<0.5 0.5 0.8>`) are two segments, because they are two
 * different places in the text: a later edit to one must not look like it edits
 * the other. Merging by value would draw the same line and hand Stage 3 the wrong
 * index.
 *
 * Pure, and it imports only TYPES from the editor's BARREL. A runtime import from
 * it drags a CommonJS dependency into the app's test loader and the file fails to
 * collect — so the range function and the step selection (`stepIndexAtCycle`,
 * which knows the arrangement sections, #1585) are passed IN by the caller that already
 * holds the real one.
 *
 * `@stave/editor/knobScale` is a different door and may be imported at runtime
 * (#1581): it is the editor's own entry for the value↔position map, bundled
 * alone with no dependencies at all, so nothing follows it in. That map is where
 * the mixer knob reads the same three rules — one owner, so a level dragged on a
 * lane and the same control turned on the knob land on the same number.
