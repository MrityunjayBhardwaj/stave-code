/**
 * The engine's BARE-CAPTURE id ↔ the timeline's lane key (#1094).
 *
 * A document that never calls `.p()` plays its last expression, and the engine
 * captures that pattern under the id an anonymous `$:` would have taken. The
 * rule is decided by `bareCaptureIdFor` in
 * `packages/editor/src/visualEdit/mixer/stripModel.ts` — the mixer owns it,
 * because the mixer is what ASSIGNS these ids while numbering its strips.
 *
 * ⚠ THE RULE IS "THE LAST TRACK", `$<n-1>` — NOT `'$0'`. Since #1096 a bare
 * document declares a Track per top-level statement, so a two-statement
 * document has strips `$0` and `$1` and the pattern strudel plays belongs to
 * `$1`. `'$0'` is that same rule at n = 1, which is the case this file pins;
 * it is not the rule itself.
 *
 * That choice is only correct because of what THIS side does with it: a bare
 * statement has no `dollarPos`, so the containment index is empty and the hap
 * falls through to the positional mapping, which lands `$<n-1>` on `d<n>` —
 * the lane the IR produces for the nth bare statement.
 *
 * The two halves live in different packages and nothing else holds them
 * together. Pinned here so a change to either is a failing test rather than a
 * timeline that silently draws a second, empty row beside the real one.
