/**
 * An arrangement whose WEIGHT is an expression draws as an arrangement (#1514).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `parseStrudel` has read `[M*8, …]` since #1468: it collects the document's
 * numeric bindings once and resolves the weight through them. The TIMELINE did
 * not run `parseStrudel` then — it ran the four staged passes, and that copy
 * collected no numeric map at all (#1558 moved the song onto `parseStrudel`, and
 * #1387 removed the copy). So `detectArrangeAt` reported two arms,
 * `songExtent` reported the right length, every serializer handled the input
 * correctly, and the timeline still drew ONE bare clip with `armIndex: -1`.
 * Every clip gesture keys off a real arm, so all of them declined at once —
 * each of them correctly, given what it was handed.
 *
 * A unit arm on either parser alone cannot see that: they disagreed, and the
 * one under test was the one that was right. So these arms drive the same
 * pipeline the app wires in `StrudelEditorClient` and assert on the far end —
 * the arm indices the gestures actually read.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THEY ARE WRITTEN IN BOTH SPELLINGS ON PURPOSE. The bare document and
 * the `$:` track take DIFFERENT branches through `parseStrudel` (`buildBindingMap`
 * vs the document-level binding map), so a suite that only ever wrote one of them would
 * leave the other free to regress in silence — which is exactly how this defect
 * survived (#1517's lesson, applied while it is still cheap).
