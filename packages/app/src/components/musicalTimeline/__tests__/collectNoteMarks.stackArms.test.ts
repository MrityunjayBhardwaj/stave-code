/**
 * Marks land on the stack arm that produced them (#950).
 *
 * Lanes are partitioned by IR structure — one per stack arm — while marks are
 * attributed by source containment. For arms that come from expanding a
 * top-level comma inside ONE `$:` statement there is no statement offset to
 * anchor on, so the arms used to share no anchor at all: the map came out empty,
 * every hap fell back to the engine trackId (identical for all arms of one
 * statement), and all marks piled onto the first arm while the rest rendered
 * empty lanes.
 *
 * The other tests in this directory mock `collectCycles` into RETURNING IR
 * events, which supplies anchors via `dollarPos`. That is the wrong scenario
 * here: #950's anchors come from `declaredTrackAnchors` reading the Track
 * wrappers on the IR itself. So this file mocks `collectCycles` to return
 * NOTHING, which is what forces the wrapper path — and it builds the IR by
 * running the REAL staged pipeline over real source, so the anchors under test
 * are the ones the app actually gets rather than a hand-drawn imitation.
 *
 * Only the haps are synthetic, and their offsets are the real ones: in
 * `$: s("bd, cp")` the two atoms sit at 6 and 10.
