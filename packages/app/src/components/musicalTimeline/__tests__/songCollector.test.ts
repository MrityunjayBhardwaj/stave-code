/**
 * The shared onset collector (#1201) — the band rule and the key remap that
 * `analyzeSong` and `analyzeWindow` must both read through.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and why it could not exist before ─────────────────
 * The collector used to be a closure built inside `MusicalTimeline`'s analyze
 * effect. Nothing could reach it, so its most load-bearing line — the filter
 * that drops a hap `queryArc` returns from two adjacent bands — was pinned by
 * NOTHING. Measured directly before writing this: deleting that filter leaves
 * all 66 arms across the four specs that touch this wiring GREEN, while
 * silently changing the cycle fingerprints and therefore the detected period.
 *
 * Extracting the collector for paging's second caller is what made these
 * assertions writable. They are the coverage that break test proved absent.
