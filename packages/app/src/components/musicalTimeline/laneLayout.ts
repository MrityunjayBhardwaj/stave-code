/**
 * laneLayout — the per-lane vertical layout for the canvas Song timeline
 * (expand + bind, #422 / canvas milestone #416, design §4.5).
 *
 * Before expand, every lane was a uniform `ROW_HEIGHT` row and three places
 * independently assumed that: the canvas draw (`drawTimeline` y-offsets), the
 * canvas host height, and the DOM lane labels. Click-to-expand makes a lane
 * taller (accordion) so its read-only note detail is legible — which means the
 * row height is no longer uniform. If each consumer recomputed y-offsets on its
 * own they would drift apart (PV116 — the shared transform must stay single-
 * sourced). So this module is the ONE place that turns `(lanes, expanded)` into
 * a `top`/`height` box per lane; the draw, the host height, the labels, AND the
 * hit-test all read the same `LaneLayout`.
 *
 * PURE — no React, no canvas, only the lane keys. Unit-tested directly.

 * the ordinary drag, by not letting a lane that is showing an automation be
