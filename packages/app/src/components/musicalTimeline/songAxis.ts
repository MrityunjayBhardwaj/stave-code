 * `songCycleToX` and the cycle `xToSongCycle` hands back are both absolute song
 * positions, never window offsets. That is deliberate and load-bearing: scene
 * clips carry absolute cycles into the EDIT path (`SceneClip.startCycle` feeds

 * to the wrong bar. The origin is applied HERE, at the pixel boundary, and

 * The extend/trim drag's own inverse: cursor x → the SONG-ABSOLUTE end cycle the

 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT `xToSongCycle` (#1203) ──────────────────────────────────
 * Two independent reasons, either of which alone rules it out:
 *
 *  1. `xToSongCycle` CLAMPS — x into `[0, width]`, and its result to just under
 *     the window end. The extend drag exists precisely to ask for a cycle PAST
 *     the current edge, which a clamped inverse can never express.
 *  2. It maps at the window's scale, which GROWS during the drag as the span
 *     extends. The trim maps at the constant rest px/cycle instead, so the
 *     dragged edge follows the cursor 1:1 with no jump as the span grows.
 *
 * So this is a THIRD exposure of the one origin, not a duplicate of the second
 * — the same shape as the clamped/unclamped split above. The alternative, doing
 * the arithmetic at the call site, is what once put the forward map's origin in
 * three places, two of which never learned about windows.
 *
 * ── WHY IT RETURNS BOTH NUMBERS ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `endCycle` is a POSITION — song-absolute, compared against
 * `SceneClip.startCycle` and written back as a clip weight. `spanCycles` is a
 * LENGTH — window-relative, feeding the drag-aware content width. They are one
 * measurement seen from either side of the origin, and deriving them separately
 * is exactly how they drifted: the end gained the origin while the span kept it,
 * so every extend at a non-zero origin inflated the content width by the origin.
 * Returning both from one place makes that particular drift unexpressible.

 * Wrap a monotonically-increasing song position into the `[0, displayCycles)`

 * full-song playhead shows the within-loop position.
 *
 * ── WHY `looping` IS A PARAMETER AND NOT AN ASSUMPTION (#1105) ───────────────
 * The modulo is only meaningful when `displayCycles` IS a loop: cycle 257 of an
 * 8-cycle song really does sound like cycle 1, so drawing it at the left edge is
 * true. When the span is instead the point where period detection gave up (the
 * 256-cycle cap — `SongAnalysis.displaySpan.kind === 'capped'`), there is no loop
 * and the modulo asserts a repeat that does not exist — the playhead would jump
 * to the left
 * edge and retrace material the transport has long since passed. Measured: 27 of
 * the 32 single-lane aperiodic corpus documents have no structural period even
 * with every shaping dimension removed, so this is the common case for them, not
 * a corner.
 *
 * Past the span with `looping: false` the honest answer is that the playhead is
 * NOT IN THIS VIEW — hence `null`, the same value every other "nothing to draw"
 * path already returns, so callers need no new branch. Parking it at the right
 * edge was the alternative and was rejected: it states a position the transport
 * does not have, which is the same class of falsehood in a quieter voice.
 *
 * The flag is REQUIRED rather than defaulting to `true`. A default would let a
 * new caller inherit the wrap silently, which is exactly how the assumption
 * became invisible in the first place; every caller now says which it means.
 *
 * ── AND WHY IT NOW TAKES A WINDOW (#1108) ───────────────────────────────────
 * With paging, "past the span" and "before the span" are both possible, and both
 * mean the same thing: the playhead is not in this view. A position of cycle 100
 * while the window shows `[256, 512)` is a transport the user has paged AHEAD
 * of — pinning it to the left edge would state a position the transport does not
 * have, which is the same falsehood this function was rewritten to remove.
 *
 * The returned position is SONG-ABSOLUTE, like everything else crossing this
 * boundary; `songCycleToX` applies the origin.
