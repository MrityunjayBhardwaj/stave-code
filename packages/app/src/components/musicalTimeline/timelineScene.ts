 * timelineScene — the render-agnostic scene model for the canvas Song timeline

 * The DOM `FullSongTimeline` drew its onset heatmap straight from `SongAnalysis`.
 * The canvas view instead draws a `TimelineScene`: per-lane density (the same
 * `onsetsByCycle` the heatmap used) PLUS capped mini-note marks (real note
 * positions) so the renderer can show readable rhythm/pitch when zoomed in and
 * coarse density when zoomed out (design §4.5). The scene is pure data over the
 * shared content-space transform (PV116) — it knows nothing about canvas, DPR,
 * or scroll. `drawTimeline` consumes it; `SongTimelineCanvas` owns the surface.
 *
 * This module is PURE (only TYPE imports from `@stave/editor`, so it stays out
 * of vitest's CJS-`gifenc` trap). The note-mark COLLECTION — which needs the
 * runtime `collectCycles`/`laneKeyOf` — lives in `timelineMarks.ts`; this
 * builder merges its already-collected output as data.

  // all — and an absent row raises nothing, it just reads as "you wrote no such
  // track". A MUTED track is the everyday case: Strudel returns `silence` for a
  // `_`-prefixed id without registering it (`@strudel/core/repl.mjs:172-175`)
  // and our capture hook mirrors that branch deliberately, so it emits no haps
  // BY DESIGN and every eval-derived source is correctly empty for it.
  //
  // So these rows come from STRUCTURE instead: the display's row set is the
  // DOCUMENT's track set. That is a DIFFERENT statement from the engine's
  // capture set equalling what the runtime plays (#1094) — the engine still
  // captures nothing for a muted track and still should not. Which is why the
  // repair lives here, in the row builder, and not at the capture hook.
  //
  // The source is `declaredTracks` — the IR's TOP-LEVEL `Track` nodes, one per
  // `$:`/`name:` statement, mute-invariant via `trackIdFromLabel` — and
  // deliberately NOT the marks annotation maps (`labelOffsetByLane` and
  // siblings). Those additionally carry lanes the RESILIENT structural walk
  // reaches on mid-edit/invalid code, plus the #927 zero-event anchor seeds;
  // promoting them to a row source is exactly the phantom row that
  // `collectNoteMarks`'s annotate-only rule exists to prevent (timelineMarks.ts
  // ~:143). A top-level Track node is a statement the user actually wrote.
  // THE KEY SPACES CAN DIVERGE, so key difference alone is not enough — and
  // getting this wrong ADDS a duplicate row, which is worse than the missing one
  // being fixed. A track's IR id and its row key are two naming systems that
  // normally agree because eval haps are attributed by SOURCE CONTAINMENT
  // (`laneKeyForHap`), which resolves both to the IR id. They diverge when
  // containment cannot run and the hap falls back to its own producer id:
  // `$: s("bd*4").p('kick')` draws its row under `kick` while the IR calls the
  // statement `d1` (`.p()` is a chain method, not the statement's label), so a
  // plain key difference invents a second `d1` row for the one track.
  //
  // Measured: that divergence needs the document to have ONE top-level
  // statement — the IR root is then a `Track` rather than a `Stack`, which is
  // the case containment misses. With two or more statements the anchors exist
  // and every row comes back keyed by its IR id (verified for `.p('name')`
  // alongside a muted track: rows `d1`,`d2`).
  //
  // So the guard is a pigeonhole on REPRESENTATION rather than on names: if the
  // display already shows at least as many rows as the document declares
  // tracks, every track is represented — possibly under a name we cannot match —
  // and nothing may be added. In the only shape where the names can disagree
  // the document declares exactly ONE track, so any drawn row satisfies it.
  // When the display is genuinely SHORT of the document, the missing tracks are
  // the ones no row is keyed to, which is what the filter names.
  //
  // SO THE MATCH IS POSITIONAL, NOT BY NAME (#1101). Both sides already carry the
  // statement offset — the declared track its label's `loc[0].start`, a drawn row
  // its `labelOffset` — and only the NAMES disagree. `containingAnchor` is the
  // reconciler the rest of this subsystem uses for exactly this (`laneKeyForHap`
  // attributes every hap by it), so asking it here means one rule with one
  // definition rather than a second, private comparison beside it.
  //
  // A declared track with NO offset is never given a row, and that is a syntactic
  // argument rather than a cautious one: an offset is the label's position, muting
  // is a PREFIX on that label (`_$:`, `_name:`), so an unlabelled statement cannot
  // be muted and is never owed a silent row. It is also exactly the pre-#1098
  // behaviour for bare documents, whose row comes from the eval capture (#1094).
  // (Consequence, deliberate: a bare `silence` statement draws no row. Nothing
  // declared it as a track, and nothing played.)
  //
  // Representation takes the UNION of both readings — a row keyed by the track's
  // own id, or a row whose offset lands in the track's statement. The asymmetry is
  // the point: a false "represented" leaves a row missing, a false "unrepresented"
  // draws the same track TWICE. Only the second corrupts what the user sees, so
