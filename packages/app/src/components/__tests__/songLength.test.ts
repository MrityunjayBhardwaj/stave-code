/**
 * `measureSongLength` — the branch that decides what a bounce can offer (#1365).
 *
 * ── WHY THESE ARMS AND NOT A MOCK OF `analyzeSong` ───────────────────────────
 * The whole value of this module is that it distinguishes a MEASURED period from
 * a horizon the analysis gave up at, and that distinction is made by
 * `analyzeSong`. Stubbing it would leave these arms asserting that a switch
 * statement routes three literals — green with the real decision entirely
 * absent. So the real `songExtent` and the real `analyzeSong` are imported by
 * SOURCE PATH (the barrel pulls `gifenc` and breaks the app's vitest loader —
 * the same route the corpus tests take) and driven with synthetic onsets.
 *
 * The collector is the one injected stub. Its correctness is already pinned next
 * door by `songCollector.test.ts`; re-testing the band rule here would duplicate
 * that, and what these arms need is control over the ONSETS analysis sees.
