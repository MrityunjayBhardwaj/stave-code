/**
 * `createEndOfSongWatcher` — the comparison that ends playback (#1388).
 *
 * ── WHY THE EXTENTS ARE REAL, NOT LITERALS ───────────────────────────────────
 * Every arm below gets its `SongExtent` from the REAL `songExtent` walking a
 * real `PatternIR`, imported by SOURCE PATH (the barrel pulls `gifenc` and
 * breaks the app's vitest loader — the route `songLength.test.ts` takes next
 * door). Hand-written `{ kind: 'opaque' }` literals would pin these arms to my
 * idea of the type rather than to what the walk actually produces, and `opaque`
 * is exactly the kind that must not drift: it is the one that would truncate a
 * real song if it regressed into the `arranged` branch.
 *
 * The clock and the transport ARE stubs, deliberately. What is under test is
 * WHEN the comparison fires, so the position has to be a sequence this file
 * controls; the runtime's own clock is pinned by `LiveCodingRuntime`'s suite and
 * observed for real in the app (#1388's listening pass).
