/**
 * When does playback END? (#1388)
 *
 * Nothing in this codebase ended playback before this module: a document was
 * started and it ran until someone pressed Stop. Measured on `b091ccc5` across
 * 691 source files, `stopAtEnd` / `playOnce` / `endOfSong` / `songEnd` were
 * zero-hit while the controls (`setcps` 34, `getSongPosition` 8, `songExtent`
 * 7) fired — so the zero meant "absent", not "differently named". It was found
 * by LISTENING, not by grepping: the first bounce of an arranged document
 * wrapped and restarted mid-capture.
 *
 * ── THE DOCUMENT DECIDES, AND IT ALREADY SAYS SO ─────────────────────────────
 * No new user-facing concept is introduced. `SongExtent` already draws exactly
 * the distinction termination needs, in its own comments:
 *
 *   { kind: 'arranged', cycles }  "A definite end. Safe to bounce whole."
 *                                 → play through once, stop at `cycles`
 *   { kind: 'loop' }              "a loop has no end"  → keep looping
 *   { kind: 'opaque' }            "its length cannot be trusted" → keep looping
 *   null / not yet measured       → keep looping
 *
 * ⚠ `opaque` MUST NOT BE TREATED AS `arranged`. Its type exists to say that an
 * arrangement is present but something unparsed sits above it, so its length is
 * untrusted — and acting on an untrusted length is precisely how #1373 offered
 * a 3:28 song an 0:08 bounce. `songExtent`'s own header states the asymmetry
 * this module inherits: being wrong towards "keeps looping" costs a keypress;
 * being wrong towards "ends here" truncates someone's song. Every ambiguity
 * below therefore resolves towards looping.
 *
 * ── WHY A PASS COUNTER AND NOT `position >= cycles` ──────────────────────────
 * The obvious comparison is wrong in two directions, both of them silent:
 *
 * 1. Song position is `scheduler.now() - transportOffset`, and `stop()` resets
 *    the scheduler cursor WITHOUT clearing an earlier seek's offset (only
 *    `record()` does that explicitly). So the first sample of a run is not
 *    guaranteed to be near zero. A bare `position >= cycles` would then fire on
 *    the very first tick and Play would appear to do nothing — the worst
 *    possible failure, because the user cannot tell it from a broken transport.
 * 2. With the loop toggle ON the position runs past `cycles` and keeps going.
 *    Turning the toggle off afterwards would, under a bare comparison, stop
 *    instantly rather than at the end of the pass being played.
 *
 * Counting PASSES — `floor(position / cycles)` — removes both. The first sample
 * of a run only establishes a baseline, never a stop; termination is a
 * CROSSING, an increase in the pass number, which is the same event whether the
 * pass being left is the first or the fifth. A stale offset degrades to
 * stopping one pass late instead of not playing at all, which is the safe
 * direction. A backwards seek lowers the baseline and re-arms naturally.
 *
 * The counting starts at ONE, not zero: see the `pass < 1` guard below, which
 * exists because the first sample of a real run is slightly NEGATIVE, and the
 * song starting would otherwise read as the song ending.
