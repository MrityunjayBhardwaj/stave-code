/**
 * How long should a bounce be — the document's own answer, typed so the modal
 * cannot mistake one kind of answer for another (#1365).
 *
 * ── WHY A TYPE AND NOT A NUMBER ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * There are three genuinely different answers and they demand different UI:
 * a document with an arrangement has a definite end; a looping document has no
 * end but may have a measurable period, so the user picks how many repeats; and
 * a document with neither can only be bounced by naming a wall-clock duration.
 * A bare number cannot tell the second from the third — and guessing wrong there
 * is silent, because a bounce of the wrong length still produces a valid WAV.
 *
 * ── THE TRAP THIS MODULE EXISTS TO AVOID ─────────────────────────────────────
 * Two different things in this codebase are called "loop", and they disagree:
 *
 *   songExtent(ir).kind === 'loop'          145 of 150 real documents
 *       "no arrangement bounds this document" — a fact about STRUCTURE.
 *   analysis.displaySpan.kind === 'loop'      82 of 142 evaluated documents
 *       "a period was measured"              — a LENGTH.
 *
 * Only the second can size a render. Reading the first as coverage for a
 * length-based feature would promise a length for 63 documents that have none.
 * `displaySpan` is a discriminated union precisely so a consumer cannot read a
 * give-up horizon as a measurement; a bounce is the most literal possible
 * consumer of "repeats every N", so it branches on `kind` and never reaches for
 * `periodCycles ?? horizonCycles`.
 *
 * Figures measured by `song-period-sweep` over the saved corpus on `0f0e75bc`:
 * 142 of 150 documents evaluate headlessly; of those, 82 carry a measured
 * period, 56 are aperiodic at the 256-cycle cap, and 4 are silent.
 *
 * ── WHY THE EDITOR FUNCTIONS ARE INJECTED RATHER THAN IMPORTED ───────────────
 * Importing the `@stave/editor` BARREL into an app module breaks that module's
 * vitest run: the barrel re-exports viz code pulling `gifenc`, a CJS module the
 * ESM loader cannot import as named exports. Production is unaffected (Next
 * interops it) so the failure appears only under test. Verified here rather than
 * assumed — a probe importing `analyzeSong` from the barrel fails with exactly
 * `Named export 'GIFEncoder' not found`. `createSongCollector` is injected for
 * the same reason: it is app-local but reaches the barrel through
 * `timelineMarks`. Type-only imports below are erased at runtime and are safe.
