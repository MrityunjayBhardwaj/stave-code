/**
 * Editor-owned Monaco keys (#745).
 *
 * These shortcuts live in scattered Monaco / editor handlers OUTSIDE the app
 * command registry, so they are not dispatched by installKeybindingDispatcher
 * and cannot (yet) be rebound here. Rather than hide them — which would read
 * as "Stave has no Run shortcut" — we surface them as READ-ONLY "System" rows
 * for reference. Rerouting Monaco through the registry is deliberately out of
 * scope (decision D2).
 *
 * Chords are in the same `mod+key` form the rest of the shell uses, so
 * `keybindingTokens` renders them identically (⌘⏎, ⌘., ⌘/, ⇧⌥F).
