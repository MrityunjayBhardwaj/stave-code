/**
 * E2E-only handle onto the binary asset store (#1500).
 *
 * The claim Phase 1 makes is "a byte gets in, survives a RELOAD, and plays as
 * `s("my_take")`". No unit test can say that — `@stave/editor` has no
 * `fake-indexeddb` and jsdom has no IndexedDB — and the slice deliberately
 * ships no UI, so there is no gesture to drive either. This probe is therefore
 * the instrument: without it the only observable half is the naming logic,
 * which is not the half that carries the risk.
 *
 * Guarded twice, exactly as `bounceProbe` is: `NODE_ENV === production` is
 * statically replaced so the body dead-code-eliminates from a real build, and
 * `__STAVE_E2E__` is the runtime gate for dev/test.
 *
 * `@stave/editor` is imported LAZILY inside the calls rather than at module
 * scope. A static import here would be dragged into every app unit test that
 * partially mocks `@stave/editor`, hiding real exports behind the mock in a
 * way `tsc` cannot see (that shape cost 52 tests once already).
