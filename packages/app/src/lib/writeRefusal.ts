/**
 * Reporting a refused surgical write, in ONE place (#1414).
 *
 * The commit door's file route, `commitToFile`, names five distinct refusals. Two surfaces write
 * through it — the Song Timeline's clip gestures and the Mixer's backdrop write
 * — and before this module they said so in two different voices: one turned the
 * refusal into a sentence, the other leaked the raw enum into a message a user
 * reads. The table belongs wherever the SECOND caller appeared, which is here.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY `warn` AND NOT `error`. StaveApp's toast bridge raises a toast for
 * errors only; warnings reach the Console panel and the activity-bar unread
 * badge without interrupting. A gesture that quietly declined should be
 * findable, not shouty — and on the timeline the clip already snaps back on its
 * own, because the canvas re-derives its extents from the IR. What was missing
 * was never the visual: it was knowing WHICH refusal fired.

/**
 * Why a region trim declined (#1527), in the same voice as the table above.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE REFUSALS FIRE BEFORE THE WRITER IS EVER CALLED, which is why they need
 * their own table rather than a sixth `WriteRefusal`. A region trim can be
 * perfectly writable as text and still be the wrong thing to write — the value
 * is patterned, the expression stacks several voices, or the lane anchor
 * resolved to an expression that does not own the region the mark is playing.
 * `commitToFile` would apply every one of those happily.
 *
 * And they matter more than the writer's own do, because the gesture leaves no
 * trace when it declines: the mark snaps back to where it was and the document
 * is untouched, which looks exactly like a drag that did not take. P787's shape
 * — a refusal correct for its input is indistinguishable from a feature that
 * does not apply — unless it says so.
