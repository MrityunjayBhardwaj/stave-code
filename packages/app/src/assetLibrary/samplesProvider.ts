 * Samples AssetProvider (#1504) — the project's OWN audio in the library.
 *
 * `AssetType` has declared `"sample"` and `AssetSource` has declared `"user"`
 * as "locally imported" since the library shipped, and until now both were
 * design notes with nothing behind them. A recorded take is exactly that
 * category, so it fills the hole rather than adding a sixth surface.
 *
 * The mapping is pure and dependency-injected, matching `soundsProvider`: the
 * app wires `readRecords` to the project document and `startPreview`/`onInsert`
 * to the audio and editor seams, so the mapping is unit-testable without a
 * Y.Doc, an audio graph, or the editor barrel.
