 * One shell, pluggable providers. Every browsable thing — sounds, viz presets,
 * snippets, user samples, and (later) community/marketplace items — is an
 * {@link Asset} surfaced by an {@link AssetProvider}. The shell renders a search
 * box + a type filter + a source filter over the union of all providers; it
 * never knows what a "sound" or a "viz preset" is. Adding an asset type is
 * registering one provider (see {@link ./registry}); adding the community store
 * is one new `source` + a remote provider, not a UI rewrite.
 *
 * `preview()` / `insert()` live ON the asset (a sound auditions and writes
 * `.sound()`; a viz preset renders a thumbnail and writes `.viz()`), so the
 * shell drives them uniformly through the row action slots.
