  // owner of that invariant and would skip the warm. This function's contract
  // is narrower and is what that effect needs: by the time it returns, the
  // records exist and their bytes are in the store.
  //
  // ⚠ Guarded per asset. The files are already in the project by this point,
  // so throwing would surface "Import failed" over a project that imported
  // fine, and one unreadable take would cost the user every other one. A take
  // that cannot be stored is skipped for the same reason its bytes are never
