/**
 * ⚠ A RESOLUTION SHIM, NOT A BEHAVIOURAL STUB — the distinction is the whole
 * point. Production imports the predicate from the `@stave/editor` barrel,
 * which is right for the app bundle and unloadable in jsdom: the barrel drags
 * `gifenc` (CJS) through an ESM resolver that cannot take its named exports.
 * Every other app test that touches the barrel does it with `import type`,
 * which TypeScript erases, so this is simply the first one to LOAD it.
 *
 * The factory therefore re-exports the REAL predicate from the engine source
 * rather than a hand-written stand-in. A stub would make these arms a second
 * oracle that passes while production's actual check is broken; this way the
 * code under test runs the same function it runs in the browser, reached by a
 * path jsdom can resolve.
