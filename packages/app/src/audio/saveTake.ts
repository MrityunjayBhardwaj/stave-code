/**
 * saveTake — audio becomes a named, persistent, playable asset (#1504, #1541).
 *
 * The join between three things that already exist: the byte store (#1500), the
 * project document's memory (#1502), and superdough's registration. Nothing new
 * is invented here; this is the order they have to happen in.
 *
 * Two things arrive at that join and only one of them used to: a RECORDING,
 * which has no filename, and a FILE the user brought in, which has one and
 * nothing else. `storeAudio` is the shared path; `saveTake` mints a name before
 * it, `importAudioFile` reads one off the file and screens the bytes first.
 *
 * ## Why the name goes in as a filename
 *
 * A take has no filename, so `nextTakeName` mints a positional one and it is
 * handed to `importAsset` AS a filename. That looks indirect but it is the
 * point: the whole import path — sanitising, the uniqueness check against every
 * other asset, the record shape — is the same code an imported file walks, and
 * a take that took a private shortcut around it would be the first asset whose
 * name was not guaranteed reachable from `s()`.
 *
 * It also handles a case a bare mint would not: `nextTakeName` guarantees
 * uniqueness against other TAKES, but a user could have imported a file already
 * called `take_1`. Routing through the shared path resolves that collision the
 * way every other collision is resolved, rather than silently producing two
 * records answering to one address.

 * ## Why this measures BEFORE it stores, when `saveTake` measures after

 * A recording is audio by construction; a dropped file is whatever the user
 * dropped. The screen is the decode itself rather than the extension, because
 * the sampler infers nothing from an extension either — but `importAsset`
 * writes the bytes before it measures, deliberately, so that a measurer which
 * throws cannot leave a record without a blob. Refusing *after* that call would
 * therefore leave an orphan blob nothing points at, every time someone drops a
 * PDF. So the decode happens here, once, and its result is handed down as a
 * constant rather than measured a second time.
 *
 * A file whose bytes will not decode is still accepted when it *claims* to be
 * audio: a codec this browser lacks is a real thing, the bytes may well be
 * playable elsewhere, and "no duration" is an answer the record already has a
 * shape for. What is refused is the file that neither decodes nor claims.
