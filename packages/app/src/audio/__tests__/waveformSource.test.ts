/**
 * The adapter between the renderer and the decoded audio (#1506).
 *
 * The tempo arm is the one that matters. Refusing to draw without a tempo was
 * the first implementation, and it made the feature unreachable: `getBpm()` is
 * documented and asserted to return `undefined` until the first successful play
 * (`workspace/types.ts:695`, `LiveCodingRuntime.test.ts:620`), so a take could
 * not be SEEN until it had been HEARD — which is the opposite of the point. It
 * was caught by reading pixels off a real canvas, not here.
