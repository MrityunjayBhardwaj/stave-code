/**
 * The whole-song analysis of the current document (#385), run whether or not
 * the Song timeline is drawn (#1726).
 *
 * It used to run inside the timeline, which the bottom drawer unmounts when
 * closed. The transport display needs the song's length to wrap the song
 * position to it (#1725), so with the drawer closed it showed the unwrapped
 * position and no pass. Now the app starts this once; the timeline reads the
 * result instead of computing its own, so there is still one analysis per
 * document, and the display gets the frame the timeline would draw.
 *
 * Every new IR snapshot (a re-evaluation) starts a new analysis and aborts the
 * one in flight, so a fast edit cadence cannot pile up overlapping budgeted
 * collections. The previous result stays readable until the new one lands, as
 * it always did in the timeline: an analysis is best-effort. Unless the snapshot
 * is another FILE's: that song's length says nothing about this one, so the
 * result is withdrawn at once.
