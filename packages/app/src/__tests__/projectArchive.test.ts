/**
 * The project archive's round trip, with a recorded take in it (#1539).
 *
 * A take has two identities — bytes in the content-addressed blob store, and
 * an `AssetRecord` in the project document that gives them a name. The archive
 * has to carry both, because either one alone leaves `s("my_take")` resolving
 * to nothing and the part silently absent.
 *
 * These arms drive the real `exportProjectAsZip` / `importProjectFromZip`
 * through a stateful fake of the editor's stores, so the zip under test is the
 * zip a user gets. The "other machine" is modelled by wiping the fake store
 * between export and import — the case that was broken.

/**
 * Provenance across the archive — the property that lived between two branches
 * (#1543).
 *
 * #1539 taught the archive to carry an `AssetRecord` and its bytes. #1541 added
 * `origin` to that record and turned it into a word the user can see and search
 * in the asset library. "A file you brought in still reads *imported* after an
 * export and an import on another machine" is a property of the PAIR.
 *
 * It could be tested on neither branch: `AssetOrigin` did not exist on one, and
 * the archive's asset code did not exist on the other. So both self-reviews read
 * complete while nothing covered the meeting point. It is covered here, now that
 * both have landed.
 *
 * ⚠ IT HOLDS BY CONSTRUCTION, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHY IT NEEDS AN ARM. Both
 * halves copy the record WHOLE — `assets.push(record)` on the way out,
 * `addAssetRecord({ ...asset, blobHash: hash })` on the way back — so a field
 * nobody named survives for free. The change that would break it does not look
 * like a break: giving the manifest an explicit field list reads like tidying.
 *
 * TWO RECORDS, NOT ONE, DELIBERATELY. A single imported take also passes when
 * `origin` is hard-coded to `"imported"` anywhere on the path. What has to
 * survive is the two being told APART, which is what #1541 newly made possible —
 * before it, every record in every project was a recording.
