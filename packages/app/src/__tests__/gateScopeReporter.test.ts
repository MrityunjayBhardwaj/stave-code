/**
 * vitest-scope-reporter — the three shapes it must tell apart (#1183).
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THESE ARE SUBPROCESS RUNS AND NOT UNIT CALLS. The reporter's first draft
 * had correct branching logic and was still wrong: it asked vitest for the CLI's
 * file filter via `ctx.filenamePattern` / `ctx.filters` / `config.filters`, and on
 * 1.6.1 all three are undefined, so a run narrowed to ONE file printed "the WHOLE
 * configured package". The defect was in the model of someone else's API, not in
 * the branching — and a unit test calling the branching with hand-made inputs would
 * have passed against the same wrong model that produced the bug. Only executing a
 * real vitest run can falsify an assumption about what a real vitest run exposes.
 *
 * That is also why the fixture is a real package rather than a mock: the
 * denominator comes from `project.globTestFiles()` resolving `include` against an
 * actual filesystem, which is precisely the part that must not be faked.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY THE FIXTURE IS COMMITTED AT `src/__fixtures__/` AND NOT BUILT IN `tmpdir()`.
 * The first attempt wrote it to a temp directory, where it has no `node_modules`:
 * `npx` then fetched an unrelated vitest and the fixture config died on
 * `Cannot find module 'vitest/config'`. Inside the workspace, resolution walks up
 * to `packages/app/node_modules` and the installed vitest is the one under test.
 * `src/__fixtures__/` is specifically the directory BOTH collectors miss — this
 * package's vitest `include` requires a `__tests__` segment in the path, and
 * playwright's `testDir` is `./tests`. A fixture that were collected would run as
 * part of the app gate and inflate the very counts this reporter reports on.
 *
 * ⚠ AND WHY THE REPORTER IS NOT IN A TOP-LEVEL `tools/`. That was the first
 * location, and it put the file outside every check in the repo: the root
 * `tsconfig.json` declares no `include` (it sweeps in the vendored
 * `artifacts/reference/` app and is nobody's gate), and `vitest` could not even be
 * resolved for its types from there, since `tools/` is in no package's dependency
 * graph. A PR about files sitting silently outside every gate should not add one.
 * It now lives beside `tests/gate-population-reporter.ts`, its playwright
 * counterpart: inside the app package's `tsc`, and collected by neither runner —
 * playwright's `testMatch` wants `.spec`/`.test`, and this package's vitest
 * `include` wants a `__tests__` segment.
