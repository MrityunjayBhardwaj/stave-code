/**
 * browserGateManifest — every browser spec is classified, so none can go unrun quietly (#1265).
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT THIS. `gate:editing:browser` used to name its spec files by
 * hand. The list was written at #952 with four files and grew exactly once, at #1245.
 * Three specs added after that — `resolver-opens-a-grid` (#1247), `chord-chart-grid`
 * (#1252) and `counted-but-empty-views` (#1258) — were never added to it, and each of
 * them is the ONLY arm that mounts the panel it covers; `chord-chart-grid.spec.ts` says
 * so in its own docblock. A fourth, `sequencer-projection.spec.ts`, then went red and
 * stayed red, and no gate had anything to say about it (#1266).
 *
 * THE LIST IS GONE. The gate now runs the whole chromium project, so a spec is gated
 * from the moment it exists and the drift is impossible rather than merely detected.
 * That became affordable once it was measured: 640 tests, 511 passed, 129 deliberately
 * skipped, 0 failed, 5.1 minutes at default parallelism. The old nine-file list survives
 * as `gate:editing:browser:quick` for local iteration, and is explicitly not the gate.
 *
 * ⚠ SO WHY KEEP THIS FILE. Because the way back is one word: re-add a path filter to
 * the script and the gate silently narrows to whatever that filter names, with every
 * count still looking healthy — which is exactly how the four specs above were lost.
 * The first arm below refuses a path filter outright. That is the whole defence; the
 * rest is bookkeeping that keeps it honest.
 *
 * ⚠ AND WHY IT DOES NOT ASSERT A TOTAL. `gatePopulationReporter.test.ts` already argues
 * the case: a pinned count "would fail on every honest spec addition and teach the next
 * person to update it without reading why". A count asks you to bump a number. This asks
 * a question — is this spec gated, and if not, why not — and the answer is written down
 * next to the file it is about.
