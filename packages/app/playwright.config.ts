/**
 * Specs whose ASSERTION IS A MEASUREMENT of real-time rendering — frames per
 * second, spectral variance across frames, reads/frame, scroll jank, a cost ladder.
 *
 * These cannot be mocked or fast-forwarded: to observe that output VARIES across
 * frames, frames must actually render, at real frame rate, on a real GPU. But
 * Playwright parallelises across FILES (~6 workers on 12 cores) all sharing ONE
 * GPU — so while these measure, five other workers are competing for the exact
 * resource under measurement. The number degrades and the spec goes red, not
 * because the product regressed but because the measurement was taken in a crowded
 * room. Below, they get the machine to themselves.
 *
 * The alternative — widening their thresholds until they stop complaining — would
 * destroy the only thing they exist for.
 *
 * The list is EVIDENCE-BASED, from repeated full-gate runs. Note what is NOT here:
 * `stave.spec.ts` also failed only under load, and looked like a member — but its
 * a11y test simply never waited for the app to render (`h1` count 0). That is a
 * race, not contention, and it was fixed at the source rather than hidden in here.
 * Serialising it would have been treating a spec bug as an infrastructure cost.
