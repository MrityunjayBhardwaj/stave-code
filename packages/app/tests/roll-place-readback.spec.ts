/**
 * Placing a note is gated on whether the document keeps it (#1333).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST. The rule is swept at model level over the whole corpus, but what no
 * model-level check can see is whether the PANEL passes the option at all. A placement that
 * silently stayed on the cheap rule would leave every corpus arm green and the click still
 * broken, because the arms call the writer directly.
 *
 * Unlike resize, placement has no cadence question to get wrong — it is one click, so the
 * check gates the write itself rather than deferring to gesture commit.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE is a corpus mini, and the pair is ADJACENT CELLS ON ONE ROW:
 *
 *     <c2*2 g2*5 [a g]>        30 columns, 3 bars, 9 notes
 *
 *   c2 column 10   accepted — the document gains the note, spelled `[g2,c2]@2`
 *   c2 column 11   refused  — ungated it wrote `<c2*2 [g2@2 g2@2 g2@2 g2@2 g2@2] [a g]>`,
 *                             which parses, re-spells `g2*5` for nothing, and does NOT
 *                             contain the note the click just made
 *
 * ⚠ THE PAIR IS THE POINT, and same-row adjacency is what makes it tight: "column 11 wrote
 * nothing" cannot be read as "this row is not clickable" or "the roll never received the
 * gesture" when column 10, one cell away on the same row in the same render, writes.

/**
 * AND THE REFUSAL SAYS SO (#1336).
 *
 * #1322 removed the invisible decline from this surface by gating the length handle, so
 * the gesture was never offered where it could not write. The readback gate reinstated the
 * same experience through a different door: the affordance is legitimately offered, the
 * writer accepts the gesture, and then the document declines to keep it — silently.
 *
 * ⚠ WHY REPORTING RATHER THAN GATING THE AFFORDANCE, measured rather than preferred. There
 * is no per-cell admissibility seam on this panel at all (`viewPlacesNotes` once per view,
 * `overlapAt` per cell), and building one costs p99 8,482ms with readback in it — against
 * the p99 21.7ms at which #1072 already declined a per-cell map here. The per-column lever
 * #1072 suggested is sound (2 of 7,984 columns are mixed) and still lands at p99 546ms,
 * the figure that made #1324 unshippable, recomputed every drag frame. Both gates are off
 * the table for different reasons, and resize could not be gated at offer time regardless
 * — its refusal depends on the length the drag ends at.
 *
 * ⚠ THE REPORT IS READ OFF THE CONSOLE PANEL, not off a count (#1443). These arms used
 * to read a running warning total from the status bar's console chip as a DELTA, because
 * that number mixed in every warning the session had raised — boot's included. `718c9bb3`
 * retired the status bar; the arms went on asking for the chip for months, timing out at
 * 30s apiece while both vitest gates stayed green.
 *
 * The Console rows carry the level, the runtime and the TEXT, so the assertion can now
 * say the message named THIS gesture rather than only that a number moved. Filtering to
 * `runtime: 'stave'` also makes the count absolute — boot's chatter belongs to the engine
 * runtimes — and the accepted arm below is the control that proves it.
