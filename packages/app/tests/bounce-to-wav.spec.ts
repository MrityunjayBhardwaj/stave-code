/**
 * ⚠ THIS ARM ASSERTS A RATIO, NOT A LEVEL, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT (#1357).
 *
 * It used to assert `headRms < 0.155` against figures measured once:
 *
 *     clean, no prior playback        0.1400
 *     after a stop, NO settle         0.1623   (+15.8%)
 *     after a stop, WITH the settle   0.1499   (+7.0%)
 *
 * That threshold went red without any code change, and the cause was not Stave.
 * Re-measured on a different audio-device state the SAME actions on the SAME
 * commit read roughly DOUBLE — 0.30621 clean, 0.31262 after a stop — and the
 * doubling reproduced against a pre-fix `dist`, which rules out the code. An
 * absolute level here measures the sound card as much as the defect, and at
 * 0.155 the old arm failed a CLEAN bounce as surely as a contaminated one.
 *
 * ⚠ Same trap as #1401, one day apart: a threshold calibrated against one
 * hardware property. There a 32s take divided evenly into 4096-frame blocks at
 * 48kHz and not at 44.1kHz; here the level itself scales with the device. When
 * an audio assertion goes red with no plausible code change, suspect the
 * measurement's dependence on hardware BEFORE suspecting whatever shipped last.
 *
 * So both readings are taken in ONE run, on ONE device state, and compared to
 * each other. The ratio band is chosen to preserve exactly the discriminating
 * power the level had: 0.155/0.1400 = 1.107 sat between the with-settle (+7.0%)
 * and no-settle (+15.8%) cases, so it passed with the settle and failed without
 * it. That is what this arm exists to catch — the RINGING TAIL regression of
 * #1356 — and 1.107 catches it identically while surviving a device change.
 *
 * ⚠ It deliberately does NOT catch #1357's residual, which is smaller than the
 * band and always was. Do not tighten this to absorb that; tightening it past
 * the residual makes the arm red for a defect it was never the detector for.
 * Measured residual on the current device state: 0.30621 -> 0.31262, +2.1%.
 *
 * ⚠ The first bounce is itself a play/stop, so the second has TWO behind it.
 * That is fine and deliberate: the elevation saturates after the first — 1, 2
 * and 4 prior cycles all read 0.31262, identical to five decimals — which is
 * also the measurement that ruled out state ACCUMULATING across evaluates.
