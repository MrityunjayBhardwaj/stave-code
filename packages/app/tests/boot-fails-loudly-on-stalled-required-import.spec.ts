/**
 * boot-fails-loudly-on-stalled-required-import.spec.ts — REGRESSION GUARD for #1215.
 *
 * THE SIBLING OF #1214, AND THE HALF ITS FIX DID NOT COVER. #1214 bounded the
 * sample manifests, which are optional content — a stall there costs some banks
 * and boot carries on. The awaits ABOVE them are not optional: `initInternal`
 * loads nine Strudel modules with `import()`, and there is no engine without
 * them. Those were still unbounded, so the three properties that made #1214
 * fatal were all still in place for a different request:
 *
 *   1. the await is unbounded — a chunk request that never answers never settles;
 *   2. `init()` memoises its in-flight promise, so later callers join it;
 *   3. it never rejects, so no catch anywhere can see it.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ WHAT THIS FIX DOES AND DOES NOT BUY — MEASURED, because the first draft of
 * this very spec asserted something the fix cannot deliver.
 *
 * It removes properties 1 and 3: the step now gives up on a deadline and says
 * loudly which step failed. It also clears `init()`'s memo, so a later
 * evaluation really does start a fresh attempt — observable as a second
 * "tierFlags read at init".
 *
 * It does NOT make a stalled module import recoverable, and no deadline of ours
 * could. The retry was measured re-entering init and then failing at the same
 * step in the same 3s, having issued NO second network request: the module
 * registry memoises the dead in-flight import one layer BELOW this code,
 * exactly as `init()` memoised it one layer above. Only a reload clears that.
 * So the honest claim is "bounded and diagnosable", not "self-healing", and
 * this spec asserts only the former. Recovery-without-reload is #1218,
 * filed rather than quietly assumed here.
 *
 * On the unfixed build none of this happens: the await hangs, nothing is
 * reported, and there is no second init attempt to observe.

/**
