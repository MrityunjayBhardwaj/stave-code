/**
 * The piano roll offers a length handle only where a drag can change the length (#1322).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST. The rule itself is model-level and gated in `roll-isolation` — 1,861
 * of 5,480 corpus notes have no reachable length the pattern can hold, checked in both
 * directions against an exhaustive sweep. What no model-level check can see is whether the
 * PANEL withholds the affordance for that reason, and whether it still offers it to
 * everyone else. Those are render decisions, so they are checked where the render is.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY ABSENCE IS PAIRED WITH A PRESENCE ON THE SAME ROW OF THE SAME DOCUMENT. In
 * `g c g c g c g c` the c at step 7 is inert and the c at step 1 is offerable — same pitch,
 * same lane, one render. Without that pairing "no handle here" cannot be told from "this
 * row was never drawn", which is the reading that would let a broken roll pass as a
 * working gate.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE "NOTHING HAPPENED" ARM IS TAKEN AFTER AN ACCEPTED EDIT, not from rest. A press
 * on an inert note writes nothing whether or not the guard is there — with the guard the
 * press returns, without it a resize drag starts and the writer declines every frame, and
 * both leave the document byte-identical. Measured from rest that arm cannot fail. Measured
 * after an accepted resize elsewhere in the same document it asserts the accepted value
 * survives, which is a state the two behaviours could differ on.
 *
 * The fixtures are corpus minis: a sweep of short round-tripping units found 12 holding
 * both an inert and an offerable note, and these are the two smallest that address cleanly
 * — one on each of `resizeNote`'s branches (single-bar, and the multi-bar `<...>` form).
