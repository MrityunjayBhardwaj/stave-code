/**
 * The instrument for #1506 — a take draws its waveform on the Song timeline.
 *
 * Every other test of this feature runs against a recording mock context, which
 * reports that a fill was REQUESTED. That is a different question from whether
 * anything reached a screen, and the difference is not academic here: the first
 * version of this feature drew the whole waveform invisibly, in the bar's own
 * colour at the bar's own opacity, and eleven green geometry arms said nothing.
 * So this spec reads pixels back off the real canvas.
 *
 * ## What is measured, and what it does not isolate
 *
 * The fixture is a one-second take that is LOUD for its first half and SILENT
 * for its second. The measurement is a RATIO of two readings inside a single
 * canvas snapshot — the height of saturated lane ink in the loud quarter of the
 * mark against the same reading in the silent quarter. Never an absolute pixel
 * count: a canvas is a device, and a stroke does not cover the columns you asked
 * for.
 *
 * The ratio establishes that what is drawn TRACKS THE AUDIO'S AMPLITUDE, in the
 * right place, at the right scale. It does not establish that the shape is the
 * correct waveform of that sample — a rendering that drew any loud-then-quiet
 * envelope would satisfy it. That is deliberate: the exact envelope is the pure
 * `computePeaks` arithmetic, tested exhaustively where it can be tested exactly.
 *
 * ## Why it reloads
 *
 * The warm-up that makes a take visible before it is played hangs off project
 * load. Importing and then reloading is the real path, not a shortcut around it.

    // The two readings compared below come from a SINGLE canvas snapshot. Two
    // page loads would be two device states, and a difference between them could
    // be a difference in the device — which is exactly the confusion an absolute
    // pixel count invites. `cat` puts the two spellings on one lane as
    // consecutive marks, so one frame holds the whole comparison.
    //
    // ## Why the QUIETEST column and not the tallest
    //
    // A mark is inked across its full width: the waveform covers only the part
    // of the mark its audio is worth, and the plain bar fills the rest at full
    // height. So the TALLEST column of any mark is the bar, whatever the
    // waveform does, and it discriminates nothing. The quietest column is inside
    // the waveform, and it is what tells a flat slice from a full-scale one.
