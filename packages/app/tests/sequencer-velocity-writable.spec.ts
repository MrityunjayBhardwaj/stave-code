/**
 * The sequencer offers a velocity drag only where the writer will write it (#1839).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST. The writer, `serializeStepGain`, was always right: it hands off
 * every leaf-read grid, because there is no column sequence of ours for a `.gain("…")` to
 * line up with. The panel predicted that answer with its own copy of the rule, and the
 * copy missed the leaf line. So on a leaf-read grid a vertical drag redrew the bar at the
 * new height and the code never changed. Only the panel was wrong, and only a rendered
 * panel shows it.
 *
 * The pair is two one-bar, one-part grids, so the old copy of the rule said yes to both:
 *
 *   `bd sd hh sd`                  element path — the writer writes `.gain(…)`
 *   `[bd - [- bd] -], [- sd]*2`    leaf-read    — the writer skips, so no drag is offered
 *
 * `data-gain` is the panel's own statement that velocity is offered on a cell: it is set
 * exactly where the drag is armed.
