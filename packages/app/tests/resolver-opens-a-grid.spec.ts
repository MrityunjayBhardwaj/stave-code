/**
 * The resolver opens a real grid in the real app (#1240) — Playwright observation.
 *
 * Every other gate for this change asks a MODEL a question: does `chunkDetect`
 * name a span, does `routeSurface` pick a surface, does the coverage harness
 * score it. All of them run against `editor/src`. The browser runs
 * `editor/dist`, mounts `PatternPanel`, and is the only place that can answer
 * "does the musician actually get a grid" — which is the entire claim of the
 * issue and the one thing no vitest arm reaches, because nothing mounts the
 * panel.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE IS THE POINT. `s(drums)` carries no string literal of its own:
 * pre-#1240 the first-literal walk found nothing, `patternKind` returned null,
 * and the Pattern tab showed its standby hint. The content lives two statements
 * up, so this also exercises the cross-statement span whose freshness guard is
 * the riskiest part of the change.
 *
 * The CONTROL arm is what makes the win attributable: an identical document
 * whose head owns its literal inline was already editable before this change,
 * so it must be editable now too. A run where both arms fail is a broken
 * harness, not a broken feature — and one where only the control passes is the
 * pre-#1240 tree.
 *
 * ── TWO MECHANISMS, TWO KINDS OF ARM (#1249) ──────────────────────────────
 * #1240 is two decisions in sequence, and the first three arms reach only the
 * first of them:
 *
 *   1. WHICH SPAN does this unit own?   `chunkDetect.resolveMini`
 *   2. WHICH SURFACE does that span open?  `panels/surfaceRoute.chunkSurface`
 *
 * `patternKind.isStepChunk` returns `step` the moment `miniString !== null &&
 * headFn === 's'`, so every fixture with a CONTENT head routes at
 * `chunkSurface`'s first line and the resolver branch below it is never
 * reached. Unwiring mechanism 2 therefore leaves the three arms above GREEN —
 * which reads as "these arms are decoration" and is the opposite of the truth.
 *
 * The last two arms carry a SILENT head (`seq`), so the head decides nothing
 * and the content is asked. They come in a pair on purpose: drums must reach
 * the grid and notes must reach the roll, so the pair pins the DISCRIMINATION
 * rather than merely that a view opened. Either one alone would pass against a
 * router that always answered the same surface.
 *
 * ⚠ The fixture has to be a BOUND reference, not an inline string. A literal on
 * a silent head (`seq("bd sd hh cp")`) is `miniVia: 'literal'`, which
 * `chunkSurface` deliberately excludes — that shape has always landed in
 * standby and moving it is a separate decision with its own measurement.
 *
 * BREAK SIGNATURES, sorted for containment rather than assumed disjoint:
 *   unwire `chunkSurface`'s resolver branch -> the last two arms only
 *   unwire `resolveMini`                    -> four of five (all but CONTROL)
 * The break must reach `packages/editor/dist`, not just `src`, or the browser
 * stays green for a reason that has nothing to do with coverage.
