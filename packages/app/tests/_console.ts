/**
 * Reading what the app TOLD THE USER, off the Console panel (#1443).
 *
 * ─── WHY THIS FILE EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three roll specs each carried their own copy of a `warnCount` helper that read a
 * `title` attribute off the status bar's console chip. `718c9bb3` retired the
 * status bar and did not touch them, so all three went on asking for an element
 * that no longer exists — six tests, each burning a full 30s timeout, for months.
 *
 * Both vitest gates stayed green the whole time, and the browser leg failed by
 * TIMEOUT rather than by assertion, so the run just took six minutes longer and
 * exited 1 at the end. Nothing pointed at the cause.
 *
 * The helper lives here, once, so the next surface retirement breaks in ONE place
 * and says so.
 *
 * ─── WHY THE CONSOLE ROWS AND NOT THE BADGE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * The chip's replacement is the unread badge on the Console's activity-bar button
 * (`[data-panel-badge="console"]`, already read by `console-badge.spec.ts`). It
 * would work, and it is the wrong instrument here:
 *
 *   1. It counts errors AND warnings in one number, so "one more unread thing
 *      appeared" cannot be told from "the refusal was reported".
 *   2. It is a count and nothing else. The old assertion could only ever say a
 *      number moved; it could not say the message named the right gesture.
 *   3. It is UNREAD work, cleared by opening the panel — so a delta read around a
 *      gesture is measuring the user's attention as much as the app's output.
 *
 * The Console rows carry the level, the runtime and the text, which is what the
 * property under test is actually about: a refused roll gesture is REPORTED, and
 * the report says which gesture. `timeline-refusal-reported.spec.ts` established
 * this shape for the same class of refusal (#1414); this is that shape, shared.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE COUNT IS NOW ABSOLUTE, NOT A DELTA. The old helper read a delta
 * because the chip's number mixed every warning in the session, boot's included.
 * Filtering to `runtime="stave"` removes the need: boot's own logging is the
 * engine's, and the app raises no `stave` warning of its own until a gesture is
 * refused. That is asserted, not assumed — every `expectNoRefusal` arm below is
 * exactly that control, and it runs on the same fixture as its refused twin.
