/**
 * Sequencer — a note is DRAWN across the columns it covers (#1056).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A BROWSER TEST AND NOT A UNIT TEST. The claim this phase closes is about
 * RENDERED GEOMETRY and nothing upstream of it: the length was already read by the parser
 * (#1010 P4b), already preserved by the printer (P4c), and already asserted per cell
 * against the engine (`cell-duration.test.ts`) — and was still invisible, because every
 * visual property of a cell derived from `isCellOn` and a sustained column is `false`.
 * Model, writer and three corpus gates all read TRUE while the user saw nothing
 * ([[PV245]]). So the observation has to be made where the pixels are.
 *
 * THE DECISIVE PAIR is the one recorded as identical when the gap was found:
 * `bd _ sd ~` (bd sounds through two columns) and `bd ~ sd ~` (bd sounds through one)
 * produced the same lit-cell picture, `bd:#... | sd:..#.`. They must now differ, and
 * differ in the RIGHT column. A test that only asserted "the second column is lit" would
 * pass on a grid that lit every column, so the full row is compared both ways.
