/**
 * gate-scope-reporter — make every vitest gate state the population it covered.
 *
 * The vitest counterpart to `gate-population-reporter.ts` beside it, which does the
 * same job for the playwright browser gate.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM THIS EXISTS FOR (#1183, split out of #1175). A gate's NAME is not
 * its COMMAND, and nothing in the output says which is which. `gate:editing:app`
 * ran a 440-test filter for months while its name promised the app package; the
 * only way anyone found out was deleting a load-bearing line and seeing whether
 * anything reddened. That is not a reasonable standing cost for knowing what a
 * green run meant.
 *
 * THE SHARPEST CASE IS `gate:editing:instruments`, WHICH EXECUTES NOTHING.
 * It pairs `vitest.instruments.config.ts` with `-t '$^'` — a pattern matching no
 * test name — so vitest imports and transforms all 31 instrument files and then
 * runs zero of them. That is deliberate and useful (#1141): a broken static
 * import reddens at transform, which is a cheap guard against instruments rotting
 * into unrunnability. But its summary line, "40 files / 67 skipped", reads in a
 * four-gate roundup exactly like a suite that passed. Anyone quoting four green
 * gates has been quoting one that asserted nothing.
 *
 * WHY THE SHAPE IS DERIVED AND NOT DECLARED. The obvious implementation gives
 * each gate a label — `scope: 'whole package'`, `scope: 'collection only'`. That
 * reintroduces the original bug one level up: a label is a claim about the
 * command, kept in step by hand, and it goes stale the moment the command changes
 * without it. #1175 was exactly a name that had stopped matching its command.
 *
 * So every line below is read off the run that is actually happening:
 *   · executed === 0 while files collected  →  collection-only, stated as such.
 *   · fewer files ran than the config collects  →  a SUBSET, with the ratio.
 *   · all of them  →  the package's whole configured include.
 * A reporter that recomputes itself cannot drift; one that is told cannot help it.
 *
 * ⚠ HOW THE DENOMINATOR IS OBTAINED, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE OBVIOUS WAY. The first
 * draft asked the reporter context for the CLI's file filter — `ctx.filenamePattern`,
 * `ctx.filters`, `config.filters`. On vitest 1.6.1 **all three are undefined**: file
 * filters are applied during collection, before any reporter is constructed, and are
 * never handed on. That draft therefore printed "the WHOLE configured package … no
 * filter applied" for a run explicitly narrowed to ONE file — a subset labelled whole,
 * which is strictly worse than printing nothing, and is the very defect this file was
 * written to prevent. It was caught by running the filtered case rather than reasoning
 * about it; the API shape had been assumed, not read.
 *
 * The denominator now comes from `project.globTestFiles()` — vitest resolving its own
 * `include` against the filesystem, at run time. Ran-files vs collectable-files is a
 * comparison the reporter can actually make, so narrowing is DETECTED rather than
 * declared, whatever caused it (CLI paths, `--shard`, `--changed`, a watch filter).
 *
 * NOTHING IS HARDCODED, ESPECIALLY NOT A TOTAL. Its sibling
 * `gate-population-reporter.ts` makes the same point for the browser gate
 * and it has already been proved right twice over: the pinned reconciliation note
 * in the playwright config said 560, the docblock's own measured figure said
 * 594/176 on 2026-08-04, and the truth on 2026-08-07 was 612/180. Written-down
 * totals drift in days. This file prints counts and the command to re-derive them.
