/**
 * Regression: a Play that lands while the engine is still initialising must
 * still produce a running transport (#815 / #1185 / #1171).
 *
 * THE DEFECT. `StrudelEngine.init()` had no in-flight guard, so overlapping
 * callers each ran the whole init body — and the body assigns `this.repl` near
 * its end. Opening the app with the Song view mounted fans out five concurrent
 * inits; if one of them finishes AFTER `play()` has started the scheduler, it
 * replaces the playing repl with a fresh one nobody started. The old repl keeps
 * making sound while every position reader sees `scheduler.started === false`,
 * `pattern` unset and `now === 0` — so the playhead is correctly withheld and
 * the LCD prints its no-position placeholder.
 *
 * ⚠ THIS SPEC IS ITS OWN TRAP: EVERY MILLISECOND BEFORE PLAY HEALS IT.
 * The failure only exists while init is still in flight. Roughly 2.8s of
 * pre-Play work — a settle wait, a sampling loop, a `waitFor` on something the
 * app publishes late — is enough for the mount path to finish, and then the
 * defect cannot occur at all. A version of this spec that boots, waits, then
 * plays passes with the bug fully present, which is worse than having no spec:
 * it reports coverage it does not have.
 *
 * So the boot below is the MINIMUM that lets a real user gesture land — the
 * panel exists, an editor exists — and Play follows immediately. Do not add
 * waits, retries, sampling, or readiness polls between `bootShell` and `play`.
 * Everything after the keypress is free: by then the race is already decided.
 *
 * MEASURED FAILURE RATE BEFORE THE FIX: 5/5 in one batch, 2/3 in another —
 * written and watched failing against the unfixed engine, because a race test
 * that has never failed is not a regression test. The rate is not 100%: the
 * engine log showed the passing runs were the ones where `play()` happened to
 * start the LAST repl init built, so nothing was left to overwrite it. That
 * residual is the defect's own coin-flip and it is gone once init runs once —
 * after the fix this spec is deterministic, so a flake here is a real signal,
 * not this test being moody.
 *
 * WHY IT ASSERTS MOVEMENT, NOT JUST PRESENCE. A playhead pinned at cycle 0 is
 * indistinguishable from a live one in a single sample, and the whole defect is
 * a transport that exists but does not advance. The position readout must
 * CHANGE, or a frozen clock would pass.
