/**
 * The Song view PAGES, and the paged window draws itself completely
 * (#1201 item 4 / #1209) — Playwright observation.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS SPEC HAD TO EXIST BEFORE THE FEATURE COULD BE CALLED DONE ──────
 * Everything about a window is correct-by-coincidence at origin 0: the window
 * frame and the song-absolute frame coincide there, so an origin-blind
 * implementation and a correct one produce identical pixels. Every unit arm for
 * paging therefore has to construct a non-zero origin by hand — and #1209 was
 * a defect that survived exactly because nothing had ever DRIVEN one through
 * the real app. A view that pages was, until this file, unobserved.
 *
 * The route to a non-zero origin is the only one the app offers: play, then
 * seek past three quarters of the first window, which is the condition the
 * rAF trigger watches. No test hook, no forced state — the same gesture a user
 * makes by clicking the ruler.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FIXTURE MUST BE APERIODIC, and the spec asserts it. Paging exists only
 * on the branch where period detection FAILED: when a period was found, cycle
 * 257 genuinely is cycle 1 and there is nothing to the right to reach. If this
 * document ever resolves to a period, the trigger never fires and every
 * assertion below would be vacuous rather than failing — so the precondition
 * is checked, not assumed.
