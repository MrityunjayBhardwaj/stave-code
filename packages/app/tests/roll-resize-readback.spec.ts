/**
 * A roll resize is settled against what the document will REOPEN as (#1331).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST, when the rule itself is swept at model level over the whole corpus:
 * the rule lives in the writer, but the CADENCE lives in the panel. The check parses, so
 * it cannot run per pointermove — gating the writer on it there took p99 to 549ms and was
 * reverted (#1324). It therefore runs exactly once, when the gesture commits on pointerup,
 * and nothing at model level can see whether the panel actually calls it, calls it with
 * the gesture's own final ask, or puts the document back when it declines. Those are
 * properties of the gesture, so they are checked where the gesture is.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE is a corpus mini, not a constructed case — the smallest that carries BOTH
 * arms on one pattern:
 *
 *     [c3@3 e3] [~ g2@2 b2]        c3@0 d=3 · e3@3 d=1 · g2@5 d=2 · b2@7 d=1
 *
 *   accepted   c3's tail dragged one column right (d 3 → 4) writes, keeping all four notes
 *   refused    g2's tail dragged one column right (d 2 → 3) would write `[c3@3 e3] [~ g2@3]`
 *              — which parses perfectly and has LOST b2
 *
 * ⚠ THE REFUSAL ARM REACHES THE REFUSAL THROUGH AN OBSERVABLE LOSSY STATE, and that is the
 * point of its shape rather than a flourish. Every frame of the drag writes under the cheap
 * rule, so mid-gesture the document really does hold the note-losing spelling; the arm
 * asserts that FIRST. Without it, "the document is unchanged at the end" cannot be told
 * from "the drag never reached the writer at all", which is the reading that lets a broken
 * gesture pass as a working decline. Asserting the restore from a state that never moved
 * is an assertion that cannot fail.

/**
 * AND THE SNAP-BACK IS EXPLAINED (#1336).
 *
 * Resize is the case that most needs saying and the ONE THAT CANNOT BE GATED AT OFFER
 * TIME AT ALL: the refusal depends on the length the drag ends at, which does not exist
 * when the handle is drawn. #1322 could gate the handle on whether a resize was possible;
 * nothing can gate it on whether THIS resize will reopen intact.
 *
 * It is also the most confusing refusal to receive, because something visibly happens —
 * the drag tracks the pointer the whole way, the bar grows, and then the note returns to
 * its original length on release. Without a message that reads as the editor breaking.
 *
 * ⚠ THE REPORT IS READ OFF THE CONSOLE PANEL, not off a count (#1443). These arms used to
 * read a running warning total from the status bar's console chip as a DELTA, because that
 * number mixed in every warning the session had raised. `718c9bb3` retired the status bar
 * and the arms went on asking for the chip for months, timing out at 30s apiece while both
 * vitest gates stayed green. The Console rows carry level, runtime and TEXT, so the
 * assertion can now say the message named THIS gesture; `runtime: 'stave'` makes the count
 * absolute, and the accepted arm below is the control that proves it.
