/**
 * Piano roll — a note's DECORATIONS belong to the note, not to its column
 * (#1078), and its selection is said as well as drawn (#1080).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST. Both claims are about rendered geometry and rendered
 * attributes on the real element. The name and the handle were in the DOM the
 * whole time, with correct content and correct handlers — they were simply drawn
 * somewhere the note was not, which no model-level test can see ([[PV245]]).
 *
 * WHY EACH CLAIM GETS ITS OWN `it`. A test body stops at its first failure, so an
 * assertion placed after a failing one is evidence for nothing — and it is the
 * MECHANISM assertion that ends up unevidenced under exactly the break the gate
 * was written for ([[PV248]], which this boundary hit twice in one session). Each
 * test below states one claim and is independently falsifiable.
 *
 * The fixture is the corpus mini the sweep found this on, not a constructed case:
 * in `[c5@0.5 f4@0.5 f5@3]`, `c5` ENDS mid-column (its handle was drawn past the
 * bar) and `f4` BEGINS mid-column (its name was drawn beside the bar). `f5`
 * covers whole columns and is the in-fixture control.

 * handle only where a drag could change the length. Asked for any length at all, on any
 * of its three notes, `resizeNote` REFUSES — so that fixture has zero handles and the two
 * arms below lost their subject entirely. They were pinning the geometry of a control
 * that never worked: #1078 predates #1318, which is what first let resize decline, so
 * until now the refusal was silent and the handle looked functional.
 *
 * `[c2@6 c2 d2@0.75]*2` is the replacement, chosen by measuring rather than by guessing —
 * only three notes in the whole round-tripping corpus end mid-column AND keep a handle,
 * and all three are in this unit. At a 900px viewport its columns sit at their 12px floor
 * (10px client box) and the three partial bars render 5px wide, which is narrower than
 * the handle's own 8px — so ONE fixture carries both arms, and the clamp below is
 * genuinely exercised rather than trivially satisfied.
