/**
 * surgery-preserves-spelling.spec.ts — the byte-surgery rung, observed in the real app
 * on the CORE-opened half (#1233).
 *
 * Everything #1233 was judged by is a corpus sweep: 775 grid byte changes, churn
 * 14,980 → 1,715, a routing census, an editor suite. Not one of them is a person
 * deleting a note and looking at their document. This is that, and it is the only place
 * the change is observed through a real gesture.
 *
 * WHAT A USER SEES WITHOUT IT. The element writer re-emits the whole element it touched,
 * at the grid's own resolution — so removing one note from a two-note group blows the
 * group open into as many columns as the bar has, and the author's `[sd hh]` comes back
 * as `[~ ~ ~ hh _ _]`. Nothing is broken: it plays identically, it re-parses, every
 * spelling assertion elsewhere still holds. It is simply not what they wrote, and it is
 * the destruction class this whole arc exists to stop.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FIXTURES ARE CHOSEN, NOT INVENTED. Both are CORE-opened (`parseStepGridCore`
 * accepts them), which is what makes them #1233's population rather than P4d's — the
 * derived half shipped at #1229 and would pass these arms on its own. They were found by
 * sweeping the corpus for core-opened deletes whose bytes differ with the overlay
 * stripped: 444 of them, of which these two are the shortest legible shapes. A fixture
 * where the two writers agree would pass with the attachment entirely unwired.
 *
 * ⚠ EXPECTED VALUES ARE THE WRITER'S, NOT MINE. Each `toBe` below is what the shipping
 * writer produces today; the comment beside it records what the ELEMENT writer produces
 * for the same gesture, which is what these arms redden to when the overlay is removed
 * from production. Verified by doing exactly that — see the break note in the issue.
