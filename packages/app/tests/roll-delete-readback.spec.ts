/**
 * Deleting a note is gated on whether the document reopens holding what is left (#1340).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST. The rule is swept at model level over the whole corpus, but no
 * model-level arm can see whether the PANEL passes the option at all — those arms call the
 * writer directly, so a delete that silently stayed on the cheap spelling rule would leave
 * every corpus arm green and the gesture still destructive.
 *
 * Delete has no cadence question: it is one gesture, so the check gates the write itself
 * rather than deferring to gesture commit the way a resize drag must.
 *
 * THE FIXTURE is a corpus mini, and the pair is TWO NOTES IN ONE COLUMN:
 *
 *     <g1, c1> - <c3, g4 - - >        9 columns, 3 bars
 *
 *   c3, column 2   accepted — the document loses only c3, spelling `<g4 c3 c3>`
 *   g4, column 2   refused  — ungated it wrote `<g1, c1> - <c3, ~ - - >`, which spells
 *                             and parses and reopens holding FEWER notes than the model
 *                             meant, because the rest lands inside the `,`-stack
 *
 * ⚠ THE PAIR IS THE POINT, and same-column adjacency is what makes it tight: "g4 wrote
 * nothing" cannot be read as "this column is not clickable" or "the roll never received the
 * gesture" when c3, in the same column in the same render, writes.

 * `718c9bb3` retired the status bar and the arms went on asking for the chip for
 * months, timing out at 30s apiece while both vitest gates stayed green.
 *
 * The rows carry the level, the runtime and the TEXT, so the assertion can now say the
 * message named this gesture rather than only that a number moved — and filtering to
 * `runtime: 'stave'` makes the count absolute, with the accepted arm as its control.
