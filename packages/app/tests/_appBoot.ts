/**
 * Shared boot / seed / transport helpers for the app's Playwright specs (#872).
 *
 * These existed as near-identical copies in ~95 spec files, and every copy carried
 * the same two defects.
 *
 * ─── 1. Monaco EXISTING is not the editor being READY ───────────────────────────
 * The editor's content is a CONTROLLED value fed by an ASYNC project-file load. A
 * `boot()` that waits only for `monaco.editor.getEditors().length > 0` returns
 * while the model is still EMPTY. A spec that then seeds its fixture is racing that
 * load — and when the load lands second, it OVERWRITES the fixture and the app
 * evaluates the STARTER instead.
 *
 * That does not merely make specs flaky. It makes them run against the WRONG SONG
 * while still reporting a result. `full-song-timeline` asserted "≥ 2 lanes" from a
 * fixture that can only ever produce ONE, and was green for its whole life because
 * the 3-track starter kept satisfying it. A lost race is not a failure — it is a
 * SILENT SUBSTITUTION OF THE ORACLE.
 *
 * So `bootApp` waits for the file load to actually LAND (model non-empty), and
 * `seedCode` then asserts the model really HOLDS the fixture before returning.
 * Order the load, then seed, then verify. Never assume what you typed arrived.
 *
 * ─── 2. Focus must arrive by GESTURE, not by `.focus()` ─────────────────────────
 * A programmatic `editor.focus()` carries no user gesture, and the app then reaches
 * a transport that reports PLAY with a NULL POSITION — the LCD prints `— —` and the
 * playhead never renders (#885). Observed, arms interleaved: real click → playhead
 * 5/5 with the position advancing; programmatic focus → 0/5, position frozen.
 * A real user's focus always arrives by click or tab, so `evalCode` CLICKS.
