/**
 * The piano roll's move and delete writers, observed in the real app (#1325/#1326).
 *
 * WHY A BROWSER TEST. Both gestures were consolidated into `place.ts` and verified
 * entirely at model level — a corpus sweep plus a vitest arm. What no model-level
 * check can see is whether the PANEL routes a decline correctly, because a decline
 * and a dropped write produce the same document: none. The distinction lives in the
 * gesture, so it is checked where the gesture is.
 *
 * Three of these had no equivalent anywhere in the suite, and one of them is a bug
 * that was caught by hand rather than by a gate:
 *
 *   - a note dragged AWAY AND BACK must come home. Mid-drag the document sits at the
 *     last accepted position, not at the base, so "declined" has to mean LEAVE IT
 *     ALONE while a drop on the note's own cell has to mean GO HOME. `moveNote`
 *     keeps them apart by IDENTITY (a refusal is the input; a restore is an
 *     equal-but-new model). Get it wrong and the note stays away — silently.
 *   - a refused MOVE must leave the document byte-identical.
 *   - a refused DELETE must leave the document byte-identical.
 *
 * ⚠ EVERY REFUSAL IS PAIRED WITH AN ACCEPTED GESTURE ON THE SAME GRABBED NOTE,
 * differing only in the target step. Without the pair, "the document did not change"
 * cannot be told from "the gesture never reached the writer at all" — which is the
 * reading that would let a broken drag pass as a working decline.
 *
 * The refusal fixtures are corpus minis, not constructed cases: a sweep of 387
 * hand-typeable corpus units found 1,650 refusing move drags and 33 refusing
 * deletes, and these are the smallest that address cleanly.
