/**
 * WHY the pins moved — attribution, not adjustment (#1010 P4c).
 *
 * Four gates changed their numbers this phase. Re-basing a pin without naming the
 * mechanism is how a figure drifts: the next reader sees a literal and no reason, and
 * the gate stops being able to say whether a later move is the same cause or a new
 * defect. So each move is attributed against the writer as it stood at
 * `studio_v0.2.0`, unit by unit, using the base modules in `__p4c_base__/`.
 *
 * Not a gate. `.spec.ts` so the normal run skips it.
