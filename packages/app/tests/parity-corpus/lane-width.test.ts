/**
 * lane-width.test.ts — what the writer emits must SOUND like the model it was given,
 * including where the model does not sit on whole columns (#1092).
 *
 * THE RULE. `@n` is a relative weight, so a roll's length and a note's position inside it
 * are not always whole numbers of columns. Every place the writer said "leave `w` columns
 * of silence" said it as a run of bare `~`, and a bare `~` is exactly one column. A gap of
 * 1.5 therefore came back as 2, which lengthens the lane; Strudel scales each comma-lane
 * to its own total, so the lanes stop sharing a grid and notes the gesture never touched
 * move. Dragging `c4` in `note("c4@1.5 e4@1.2")` moved `e4` from `[0.5556, 1.0000)` to
 * `[0.6250, 1.0000)`.
 *
 * WHY IT IS COMPARED THROUGH THE ENGINE and not by re-reading the output ([[P301]]): every
 * wrong output this gate exists to catch re-parses perfectly well, and several of them
 * re-parse to lanes with EQUAL sums — `c4@1.5 e4@1.5` came back as two lanes of 3.5 where
 * the pattern is 3. A gate asserting the lanes agree with each other reads green over that.
 * The comparison is against plain arithmetic on the model (`start / steps`), which never
 * goes through the writer.
 *
 * THE POPULATION, stated rather than implied ([[P345]]). The comparison "the whole output
 * sounds like the whole model" is only sound where the model IS the whole mini — a flat
 * top-level token sequence. Nested and multi-bar minis are excluded because there the
 * writer returns a document region whose columns are not `model.steps` wide; they are
 * covered by `round-trip` and `edit-locality`, not here. Of 544 corpus rolls, 94 are flat.
 *
 * AND THE GATE MUST BE ABLE TO FIRE ([[P353]]). ZERO of the 544 corpus rolls carry a
 * fractional note position, so the corpus arm alone is green before this change and after
 * it — it is a REGRESSION FLOOR, not evidence. The evidence is the fixture arm, which runs
 * the same comparison over hand-written input the defect was found on and which fails on
 * every one of them without the fix. Both are reported; neither is allowed to stand for
 * the other.
