/**
 * _1052-resolution-truth.spec.ts — THROWAWAY INSTRUMENT. Does the grid behave the way
 * a DAW's grid is supposed to behave?
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1052-resolution-truth.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * THE SPEC, in the product's own terms (#1052), as three separable claims:
 *
 *   1. FREE      changing the grid alone changes only the VIEW. Your file is not
 *                touched. (Ableton's Narrow/Widen Grid: you zoom, your MIDI does not
 *                move.)
 *   2. TRUE      the finer view is a faithful picture of the document underneath. A
 *                note occupying one cell at 8 occupies two at 16 — same music, drawn
 *                at twice the density, nothing invented and nothing lost.
 *   3. HONEST    mutating AT the finer grid may legitimately change the code, because
 *                the user asked for something the old resolution cannot say. What it
 *                may NOT do is disturb anything they did not touch.
 *
 * 1 and 2 are about looking. 3 is about writing, and it is the one with teeth: a write
 * that spells the finer grid is CORRECT, and a write that also re-spells the notes
 * either side of it is the failure #1052 exists to prevent.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT ANSWERED BY WHAT IS ALREADY HERE ──────────────────────────
 * `free-zone-equivalence.test.ts` gates claim 1 and `cell-coverage.test.ts` gates a
 * piece of claim 2, both over their own populations. Claim 3 has only ever been
 * measured in BYTES (`_1007-subdivide-route.spec.ts`: the shipped route moves p50
 * 0.298 of a long document against a leaf delete's 0.036). Bytes cannot say whether
 * the notes that moved still PLAY the same — a faithful re-spelling at a finer
 * resolution moves bytes and changes no music, and that is precisely the case the
 * byte metric cannot tell from destruction. So the arm that matters here is the one
 * nobody has run: the ENGINE on both sides of the shipped write.
 *
 * ── THE ORACLE, AND WHAT COUNTS AS DAMAGE ─────────────────────────────────────
 * `enginePlayedCycle` on the source and on the emitted document, every bar the model
 * spans, keyed (onset, duration, atom) — the project's one definition, never a
 * re-parsed column grid ([[P301]]: `[~ 1@2]` and `[~ ~ 1@4]` are the same music).
 *
 * The verdict is deliberately ASYMMETRIC, because the two directions mean different
 * things:
 *   added   — the note the user just placed. Exactly 1 is the whole point of the
 *             gesture, so this is the SUCCESS axis.
 *   removed — a note that was in the document before and is not in it now, or is
 *             now at a different instant/length/value.
 * A byte ratio cannot separate these two and this can.
 *
 * ⚠ AND "removed" IS STILL TOO COARSE FOR DAMAGE — re-cut after the first run, which
 * read 835 of 934 as damaged. Almost all of it is the PLACEMENT CLAMP: put a hit in
 * the second half of a cell and the note already there must shorten to make room, so
 * `bd - - -` becomes `[bd bd] - - -`, removing `bd@0.25` and adding `bd@0.125`. The
 * note did not go anywhere; it got shorter, and that is the gesture working (#1064
 * made it sanctioned, and `1058` counts it the same way). So the verdict splits:
 *   CLAMPED  — something in the result still starts at that instant with that value
 *   VANISHED — nothing does. The note stopped sounding, and this is the real loss.
 * Reporting one number for both would have called the feature a defect on 89% of the
 * corpus.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE COMPARISON MUST COLLAPSE, for the same reason `GRID_SURFACE.collapses` is
 * `true`. Both units the re-cut still flagged were the documented collapse rather than
 * loss — `[d4,f4,d4]` and `hh(<3,7>,16)` — so the surface's own rule is applied to
 * both sides instead of an exception being carved for the two that tripped it.
 *
 * ── CALIBRATION BEFORE ANYTHING IS READ ([[PK103]] step 7) ────────────────────
 * Three figures already known from other instruments are re-derived here and
 * asserted: 1021 units opening a step grid, 1013 DISTINCT units with an identity base
 * (`1058-refined-placement`), and 934 route-A placements posed
 * (`_1007-subdivide-route`). If any moves, this instrument is measuring a different
 * population and its treatment columns mean nothing.
 *
 * ── CONTROLS, AND THE DISTINCTION CALIBRATION DOES NOT COVER ──────────────────
 * The three anchors above prove the POPULATION is the one other instruments measured.
 * They say nothing about whether the CHECKS work — and claims 2 and 3 both come back
 * clean, which is exactly the shape that cannot be told from a check that never looked
 * ([[P525]]). So each is put in a position where it must fail:
 *
 *   claim 2  asked of a x3 view while still expecting a x2 doubling
 *            -> fires 935 of 935 (100%)
 *   claim 3  the identical engine check run on ROUTE B, the model-rescale road
 *            -> fires: 72 units lose 568 notes outright
 *
 * THE SECOND CONTROL IS ALSO A FINDING, and a larger one than the byte ratio it was
 * built to check. Route B does not merely move more of the document (p50 0.988 against
 * route A's 0.298) — it DESTROYS MUSIC: 72 of 934 units come back with notes that no
 * longer sound at all, where the shipped road loses none. So the two roads differ in
 * SAFETY and not only in tidiness, and "the subdivide is destructive" is true of the
 * road nobody ships and false of the one everybody uses.
 *
 * ⚠ ONE ASK PER UNIT, first admissible odd column, scanned col-then-lane — the SAME
 * order the route probe uses, so the two runs describe the same 934 asks. This is a
 * SYSTEMATIC position, not a sample of where users click: the first empty odd column
 * sits early in the document, usually inside the first element. Damage that only
 * appears at later positions would not be seen here.
 *
 * ⚠ SCOPE, stated rather than implied: x2 only, GRID only, mini strings rather than
 * whole documents, and the engine window is the model's own `bars` — a pattern whose
 * period exceeds that is compared on a PREFIX of its denotation. The corpus is 1633
 * entries / 1625 distinct (duplication is negligible), p50 16 chars, and only 17% are
 * >= 40 chars, so the long-doc rows quoted elsewhere rest on n=84 of 934.

/* ── THE WINDOW HOLE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every engine comparison in this file — and in `writer-reach`, `1058` and the rest —
 * runs over the model's own `bars`. That is a claim about a PREFIX of what the pattern
 * plays, not about what it plays. `<a b c>` against `<x y>` repeats every 6 cycles; a
 * one-bar window sees a sixth of it. This is not a randomness problem (Strudel's RNG is
 * deterministic per time, so a given cycle always plays the same thing) — it is a
 * COVERAGE problem, which is worse, because it fails silently and identically on every
 * run.
 *
 * PERIOD IS OBSERVED, NOT INFERRED. Deriving it from `<>` nesting would be a second
 * model of Strudel's own semantics ([[PV192]]) and would be wrong exactly where the
 * grammar is subtle. Instead: query cycles 0..15, take each cycle's signature with
 * onsets normalised into [0,1), and find the smallest p for which cycle k and cycle k+p
 * agree for every k in view. No such p means the pattern does not repeat inside 16
 * cycles, and that is reported as UNVERIFIABLE rather than folded into either verdict.
