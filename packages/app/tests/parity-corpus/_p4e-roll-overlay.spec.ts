/**
 * _p4e-roll-overlay.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT. What a leaf-span OVERLAY would actually do
 * with the roll's 129 non-local deletes (#1232), asked per unit rather than counted.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_p4e-roll-overlay.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * ⚠ 129 IS A CEILING, NOT A PRIZE. `_p4e-roll-locality.spec.ts` counts the deletes that
 * move more of the document than the note's own text; that count says nothing about how
 * many an overlay could actually answer. A leaf projection may not exist for the mini at
 * all, and where it does the width guard or the shared-leaf rule may still refuse. This
 * asks the WRITER, per unit, instead of restating its rule here — the only reading that
 * can be trusted, because any "would surgery take this?" predicate written in a test is
 * a second copy of the decision production already makes.
 *
 * HOW IT ISOLATES SURGERY'S OWN ANSWER. `PianoRollModel.leafSource` is terminal: the
 * writer tries byte surgery and returns null rather than falling back. So moving the
 * overlay `surgical` spans into `leafSource` on a copy of the model gives exactly the
 * overlay's first branch with the fallback suppressed — non-null is what surgery wrote,
 * null is the refusal that falls through to today's writer. Nothing here re-implements
 * `anchorsDescribe` or the shared-leaf rule; both are reached through the real call.
 *
 * That also makes this a live check on the ATTACHMENT rather than only on the writer:
 * a unit reported "no leaf spans" is one `withRollSurgery` did not attach to.
 *
 * The delete mirrors `_p4e-roll-locality.spec.ts` note for note, so the two populations
 * reconcile — its 129 is this file's denominator.
