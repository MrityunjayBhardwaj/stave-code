/**
 * _1007-subdivide-locality.spec.ts — THROWAWAY INSTRUMENT. Does subdividing AUTHOR
 * notation, or does it splice locally?
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1007-subdivide-locality.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * THE QUESTION. #1007's "honest irreducible" #1 says: "Replacing an existing `~` is
 * surgery; subdividing is not." P4e then measured a subdivide+place as reaching NO
 * surviving `reemit*` site (934 asks, 0 hits) — answered by the part rebuild inside
 * the splice path and by `rebuildGrid`. Those two statements are in tension and
 * NEITHER settles it, because "reaches no re-emit site" is not the same as "does not
 * author": the splice path's own comment says it re-reads the part at a finer width
 * and spells ONE element as a group, which is authoring at a smaller scale.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS PROBE DRIVES ONE OF TWO ROUTES, AND IT IS NOT THE SHIPPED ONE (#1300 —
 * measured after this file was written, by `_1007-subdivide-route.spec.ts`). It reaches
 * the refined model through `scaleStepGrid(model, 'double')`, a model-space rescale
 * that no production code outside `resolution.ts` calls. The panel takes the other
 * road: a refined VIEW, `parseStepGrid(mini, k)`, whose model still carries the source
 * regions — and on that road the same 934 asks move p50 0.298 of a document >= 40 chars
 * rather than 0.987, leaving every neighbouring part byte-identical. Every figure below
 * is SOUND and is scoped to the model-rescale road. Read the paired run for the
 * product's cost; read this one for what a writer does once the source description is
 * gone.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, and why it is not a second oracle. Not "did it author" — that
 * would be a rule of my own, re-deciding what the writer decided ([[P519]]). Only the
 * DOCUMENT: how many bytes moved, as the span between the common prefix and the common
 * suffix. Same `changedWidth` as `_1233-byte-change.spec.ts`, deliberately, so the two
 * runs are comparable.
 *
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR, both columns written BEFORE the run ([[P527]], [[PV347]]):
 *
 *                              AUTHORING                 LOCAL
 *   changed/len                ~1.0, whole part          small, near the leaf anchor
 *   vs the leaf anchor         far above                 comparable
 *   vs the rebuild anchor      comparable                far below
 *
 * TWO ANCHORS, MEASURED IN THE SAME RUN ON THE SAME UNITS so neither is quoted and
 * neither can silently be the same arm twice ([[P546]]):
 *   - `leaf`    — a delete answered by byte surgery. The most local write there is.
 *   - `rebuild` — a write that re-derived the line from the model. Pure authoring.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GESTURE IS GUARDED, because this is exactly where P4e lost one ([[P606]]):
 * `scaleStepGrid` takes `'double' | 'halve'` and vitest does not typecheck, so a wrong
 * literal runs, falls to the halve branch and reports a silent zero. `posed` counts
 * only asks where the model VERIFIABLY doubled, and it is asserted non-zero.

/**
 * ⚠ REVISED AFTER THE FIRST RUN REFUTED THE FIRST DESIGN, both halves recorded rather
 * than quietly replaced:
 *
 * 1. THE REBUILD ANCHOR CAME BACK EMPTY (n=0). A delete never takes that path, so the
 *    AUTHORING end of the scale did not exist and "0.833 is near authoring" would have
 *    been an unanchored claim. Replaced by a strictly better discriminator: split the
 *    SAME gesture on the SAME units by the writer that answered it. `splice` vs
 *    `rebuild` then differ only by the writer, which is the whole question.
 * 2. THE RATIO IS CONFOUNDED BY DOCUMENT LENGTH. The leaf anchor — pure byte surgery —
 *    reported "whole document moved" on 251 of 685 units, which cannot be right for a
 *    write that copies every byte it did not edit. The corpus median mini is ~16 chars,
 *    where ONE element IS most of the document. So absolute bytes and the document
 *    length are reported beside the ratio, and a LONG-DOC row (>= 40 chars) is printed
 *    where the ratio can actually discriminate.
