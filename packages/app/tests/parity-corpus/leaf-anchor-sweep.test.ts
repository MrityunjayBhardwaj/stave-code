/**
 * leaf-anchor-sweep.test.ts — the whole-corpus proof that a shipped GRID leaf
 * anchor slices to its own token (#986 P1a, PR #987 self-review finding #1).
 *
 * The leaf-anchored projection writes an edit by replacing the bytes at a hap's
 * `context.locations[0]` span. That is only sound if the span really IS the
 * played atom's own token — and `loc[0]` is the leaf for MOST bare reified minis
 * but not all: a `..` range gives each generated note the range END's location, a
 * patterned operator (`*<8 [4 16]>`) puts its own argument first, and a `.`
 * phrase separator can pad a token's span with a trailing space. `leafAnchors`
 * (in parse.ts) is exactly the guard that REJECTS any onset whose span does not
 * slice to its token, so those patterns never open a leaf view.
 *
 * This gate proves the guard holds over the full committed corpus, at scale:
 *  1. every anchor in every SHIPPED leaf model slices to its atom (0 exceptions)
 *     — the property a regression in the guard would break, corrupting on the
 *     first click;
 *  2. the guard is LOAD-BEARING, not vacuous — the raw `gridOnsets` stream does
 *     carry non-slicing spans that never reach a view (asserted > 0, so a guard
 *     that silently started accepting them would be caught).
 *
 * THE ORACLE is the shipped `parseStepGrid` / `gridOnsets` — never a
 * re-implementation, which could only agree with itself.

/**
 * #986 P2 — THE BIJECTION, HELD OVER EVERY SHIPPED VIEW.
 *
 * The projection's whole editability rule is one property: a played note is
 * view-editable exactly when it maps to a source span that is its OWN and that no
 * other note's span partly claims. `claimLeafSpan` states it once and both
 * surfaces ask it; the ~25 syntactic guards in the core are the same rule detected
 * feature-by-feature, which is why they need a case for nesting, for `*n`, for
 * every spelling, and this needs none.
 *
 * The sweeps above already hold the first clause — a shipped anchor slices to its
 * own token. This holds the two nothing gated at corpus scale:
 *
 *  - DISJOINTNESS: any two anchor spans in one view are IDENTICAL or do not
 *    overlap at all. Identical is the normal case and means shared (`bd*4` is one
 *    token played four times, and the writer makes the sharers agree). Partial
 *    overlap is the one no byte replacement can satisfy, because the two notes
 *    disagree about who owns the bytes between them — a view shipped with that in
 *    it corrupts on a click, silently.
 *
 *    Measured honestly, and unlike its sibling clause this one is DEFENSIVE, not
 *    load-bearing: across the whole corpus, on both surfaces, exactly ZERO span
 *    pairs that pass the slices-to-its-own-token clause then partly overlap. The
 *    clause below therefore proves the property holds, not that it is exercised —
 *    which is the opposite of what the two "load-bearing" sweeps above assert, and
 *    is stated rather than implied so nobody reads a passing test as evidence the
 *    guard is doing work. It stays because it is the other half of the rule and
 *    the cost of asking is a comparison.
 *  - TOTALITY: every cell the view DRAWS has an anchor behind it. A drawn cell
 *    with nothing to write through is a dead control — the failure #986 P1a's
 *    usable-view gate exists to prevent, asserted here as a property of the model
 *    rather than of one fixture.
 *
 * THE ORACLE is the shipped parser. These read the models it actually returns; a
 * re-walk of the anchor logic could only agree with itself.
