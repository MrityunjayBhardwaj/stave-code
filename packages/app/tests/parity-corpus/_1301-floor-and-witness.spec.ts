 * _1301-floor-and-witness.spec.ts — THROWAWAY INSTRUMENT. Of the bytes the shipped
 * writer moves, how many did the ASK force and how many are slack?
 *

 *
 * THE QUESTION (#1300's last open item). The shipped subdivide+place moves p50 0.298
 * of a document >= 40 chars where a delete answered by byte surgery moves 0.036 — about
 * 8x. Every figure in that comparison is measured against NOTHING, so it cannot tell
 * "the notation forced this" from "the writer was lazy". A subdivide genuinely has to
 * spell a group where a delete only has to overwrite one atom, so part of that gap is
 * the ask and not the answer, and no instrument so far can say which part.
 *
 * THE MOVE: never measure a cost against nothing. Two bounds beside every cost, on the
 * same unit, for the same ask.
 *
 *   FLOOR    the bytes of the SOURCE that denote the thing being edited. A correct
 *            answer has to disturb those; it does not have to disturb anything else.
 *            Two nested floors, because they answer different questions:
 *              LEAF   the edited note's own atom span (`LeafAnchor.span`)
 *              REGION the top-level element containing the edited column
 *                     (`SourceRegion.raw`, minus its padding)
 *            LEAF is inside REGION by construction, and C5 checks exactly that.
 *            ⚠ THE NOTE A SUBDIVIDE CREATES HAS NO BYTES, so it has no LEAF of its own
 *            — which is why REGION is the floor that travels across both gestures. But
 *            the ATOM WHOSE SLOT IT SPLITS does have one, and that is a second, tighter
 *            floor for the same ask: placing into the back half of `g3` need only
 *            re-spell `g3` as `[g3 x]`. Both are reported, and they answer different
 *            questions — REGION asks did the writer stay inside the element it had to
 *            touch, ATOM asks did it stay inside the note.
 *
 *   WITNESS  ANOTHER CORRECT ANSWER to the same ask, produced by a different writer.
 *            Where byte surgery can answer, the unit is asked twice: once as shipped
 *            (surgery answers) and once with the overlay stripped, so the element
 *            writer answers. An ACHIEVED bound rather than a derived one — whatever
 *            surgery spent, the ask is answerable in that many bytes, demonstrably.
 *            Same paired-A/B-on-one-tree technique as `_1233-byte-change.spec.ts`,
 *            reused rather than re-invented ([[P546]]: never a stash as a control arm).
 *
 * WHAT IS COMPUTED, all in BEFORE-document byte coordinates:
 *
 *   COST     `changedWidth(before, after)` — copied verbatim from
 *            `_1007-subdivide-locality.spec.ts:58` / `_1007-subdivide-route.spec.ts` /
 *            `_1233-byte-change.spec.ts`, so all four runs stay comparable.
 *   SLACK    bytes of `before` OUTSIDE the floor that did NOT survive the write, head
 *            and tail measured separately against the common prefix and suffix — see
 *            `slackOutside`, and read the refuted first design there before reusing it.
 *
 * SLACK IS WHAT WAS AVOIDABLE AND `COST - SLACK` IS FORCED. A writer that grows `bd`
 * into `[bd bd]` pays a large COST and zero SLACK: every byte it spent was inside the
 * span it had to touch. That is optimal, not lazy, and a byte ratio cannot see the
 * difference — which is the whole reason this file exists.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT A ZERO LICENSES, and it is less than it looks. Zero SLACK against a floor says
 * the write stayed inside THAT span. It does not say the spelling inside the span is the
 * shortest correct one — a claim of "local", never of "minimal". The two floors narrow
 * that gap without closing it: the ATOM floor is much tighter than the ELEMENT floor,
 * and a zero against it still permits a wasteful spelling of the atom itself.
 *
 * THE FLOOR IS A PROPERTY OF THE ASK AND THE SOURCE, NOT OF THE WRITER'S MODEL — and
 * that is what makes it usable as a control. It is derived ONCE from the document-
 * resolution parse of the mini, then applied unchanged to every arm. `scaleStepGrid`
 * drops `source` (a re-laid grid makes every region a lie), so a floor read off the
 * writer's own model would simply not exist on the arm most in need of measuring.
 *
 * CONTROLS, because a clean reading from a detector never shown to fire is not evidence
 * ([[P610]], [[PK104]] step 6). Each is printed with its rate beside the result:
 *
 *   C1 TILING       the regions must reconstruct the source BYTE-FOR-BYTE
 *                   (`prefix` / `part.before` / `region.raw` / `part.after` / `suffix`).
 *                   If they do not, the offsets are fiction and nothing may be read.
 *   C2 FIRES        asked of ROUTE B, the model rescale that re-derives the whole line.
 *                   EXCESS must be large there or the detector cannot fire at all.
 *   C3 SILENT       asked of the LEAF arm, which replaces exactly the note's own bytes.
 *                   EXCESS must be 0 there or the floor construction is wrong.
 *   C4 NON-VACUOUS  the floor must be a STRICT SUBSET of the document on a real
 *                   sub-population, else every EXCESS is 0 for an uninteresting reason.
 *   C5 ON TARGET    the note's own LEAF span must lie INSIDE the region that contains
 *                   its column. Two independently-derived facts about the same bytes —
 *                   krill's locations on one side, the tiling walk on the other — so a
 *                   column-to-region mapping off by one element is caught by something
 *                   other than itself ([[PV200]]).
 *
 * ⚠ C5's FIRST FORM DID ITS JOB BY FAILING, and the failure was in the metric rather
 * than in the code under it — see `slackOutside` for the refuted design and why a pure
 * insertion made the first slack detector unable to fire. Both halves are kept there.
 *
 * OBSERVED 2026-08-18 on `14f7ea0c`, 1633 minis -> 1021 grid units -> 874 with a
 * reconstructible tiling -> 873 asks of each gesture. Long docs are >= 40 chars, because
 * the ratio is confounded below that (corpus p50 is ~16, where one element IS most of
 * the document).
 *
 *   arm                                        n    cost   slack   slack==0
 *   ROUTE A subdivide+place vs its ELEMENT    873   0.286   0.000   873/873
 *   ROUTE A subdivide+place vs its ATOM       585   0.240   0.086   501/585
 *   ROUTE B model rescale   vs its ELEMENT    873   0.987   0.494   428/873   <- C2
 *   delete by byte surgery  vs its ATOM       604   0.034   0.000   604/604   <- C3
 *   delete by the element writer vs its ATOM  604   0.116   0.031   536/604
 *
 * THE ANSWER TO #1300's LAST ITEM: the shipped 0.298 is NOT reach. Route A left the
 * element it had to touch on ZERO of 873 asks, where the same detector catches route B
 * leaving it on 445. The residue over the delete anchor is the ask, not the writer.
 * What IS avoidable sits one level down and is a SPELLING question: on 84 of 585 the
 * write spreads beyond the atom it subdivides, re-spelling the whole element flat at the
 * line's shared division (`[g3 f#3]` -> `[g3 g3 ~ ~ ~ ~ f#3 _ _ _ _ _]`) where a nested
 * `[[g3 g3] f#3]` would touch four bytes. No writer in the tree spells the nested form,
 * so that floor is DERIVED and has no witness — it is what a correct answer could cost.
 *
 * TWO CHOICES IN THE PAIRING, both deliberate and both making the result harder rather
 * than easier to reach:
 *   - THE SAME COORDINATES, not the same rule. The target (lane, column) is chosen once
 *     on the refined view and REPLAYED on the rescaled model, where `_1007-subdivide-
 *     route.spec.ts` re-ran its scan per route. Both arms report 873, so the coordinates
 *     transferred on every ask, and the two roads answer literally the same question.
 *   - NO IDENTITY-BASE PRECONDITION. Route A's own probe requires `serializeStepGrid(m)
 *     === mini` before measuring, because "the document did not change" is meaningless
 *     if the writer never reproduced it. Nothing here compares against a re-serialization
 *     — only before against after — and dropping the precondition can only ADD writes
 *     that re-spell bytes for reasons unrelated to the ask, which inflates slack. So a
 *     zero measured without it is the stronger statement.
 *
 * SCOPE, stated in the artifact rather than in a reply ([[PK104]] step 9). Step grid
 * only; scale factor x2; mini strings, not whole documents; the ask position is
 * SYSTEMATIC — the first empty odd column scanned column-then-lane — and is not a
 * sample of where a user would click. The roll is not measured. Units whose source is
 * an `<...>` alternation (`altSource`) carry no reconstructible tiling and are reported
 * as UNCOVERED rather than modelled from a second guess.
