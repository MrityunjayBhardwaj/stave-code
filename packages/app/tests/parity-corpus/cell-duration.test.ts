/**
 * cell-duration.test.ts — the step cell's LENGTH is a length the engine played
 * (#1010 P4b).
 *
 * WHY THIS GATE EXISTS. `StepLane.cells` now carries how long each note sounds, and
 * the three read paths compute it three different ways:
 *
 *   - the syntactic core walks the AST and uses the SLOT'S SPAN in columns
 *   - the two projected paths read `whole.end - whole.begin` from the haps and scale
 *     cycles → columns by `perBar`
 *   - the leaf path takes the anchors' atoms and the played lengths, matched per column
 *
 * "The span is the length" was an INFERENCE when it was written — both quantities came
 * out integral in a sweep, which is not the same as being equal. This asserts it, per
 * cell, over the whole corpus. If a slot's span ever stops being what the pattern
 * plays, the cell would carry a plausible wrong number and the printer (P4c) would
 * spell it faithfully; that is precisely the silent-corruption class this phase exists
 * to close ([[PV239]]), so it gets a gate rather than a comment.
 *
 * WHAT EACH ARM CAN AND CANNOT CATCH — stated because the arms are not equally strong:
 *   - SYNTACTIC path: fully independent. The structural length never touches the
 *     engine, so agreement is real evidence.
 *   - PROJECTED paths: partly circular — cell lengths and the expected lengths both
 *     descend from the same `queryArc`. What it still checks is the cycles→columns
 *     conversion and the column placement, which is where a unit error would live.
 *
 * POPULATION: every `mini-corpus.json` unit that opens a step grid, split by path and
 * printed, so a path emptying out fails instead of quietly shrinking the denominator.
 * SAMPLING DEPTH: the model's OWN window, `bars` cycles (1 when single-cycle) — not a
 * fixed 4 or 16. A grid's cells cover exactly `bars` cycles, so a hap at cycle 5 of a
 * single-bar model is a hap no cell exists for; sampling wider counts lengths the cell
 * never has to carry, which is how the first version of the P4b sweep talked itself
 * into a defect that was not there ([[P359]] for why depth is stated at all, [[P343]]
 * for why the population is).
 * COMPARISON: a cell's length must be ONE OF the lengths the engine played for that
 * sound at that column — a multiset membership, not equality, because a `,`-stack can
 * land the same token twice on one column with two lengths and the cell displays the
 * first. The count of such columns is reported, so the weaker form's scope is visible.
 *
 * CONTROL ARM ([[P353]] — a green from a comparison never shown to fire is not
 * evidence): a degenerate reader that returns 1 for every length is run through the
 * same comparison and MUST be caught, on a named unit and corpus-wide.
