/**
 * _1235-swallowed-length.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT, not a gate. How many length edits the
 * leaf writer reports as a successful write while returning the source bytes unchanged.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1235-swallowed-length.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT ASKS. `spliceByLeaf` decides what changed by comparing TOKENS, and `LeafAnchor`
 * is `{ atom, span }` — no length. So a note the user lengthened or shortened is invisible
 * to it: it finds no difference, writes the source back, and returns it as a write. This
 * counts that population directly, on three carriers, because the answer differs per
 * carrier and "is it live today?" is the question that decides the fix's urgency:
 *
 *   leafSource   the leaf projection OWNS the view (terminal, no fallback)
 *   surgical     P4d's overlay on the DERIVED element path — SHIPPING TODAY
 *   simulated    the same overlay on the CORE element path — what #1233 would add
 *
 * ⚠ IT ASKS THE MECHANISM. The resize comes from `resizeCell`/`resizeNote` (the panel's
 * own ops) run against a model with the overlay STRIPPED, so the op's own perceptibility
 * guard cannot hide the case ([[#1053]]: `resizeCell` returns its input when the document
 * would not move, which is exactly what a swallow looks like from outside). The verdict
 * comes from `serializeStepGridWithExtent` / `serializePianoRollWithExtent`, the writers
 * themselves. Only the ATTACHMENT is modelled here, and that is the candidate change.
 *
 * A SWALLOW is: the control arm (no overlay) writes DIFFERENT bytes, and the treatment arm
 * answers `path: 'leaf'` with bytes IDENTICAL to the source. Anything else — a refusal, a
 * genuine agreement, a decline — is not this defect.
