/**
 * A/B EQUIVALENCE — the derived arrays against the ACTUAL pre-change reader.
 * Proves inertness by observation over the real corpus rather than by
 * construction, which is the claim that matters for a representation change.
 *
 * RESULT WHEN RUN (2026-07-26, against `b08326cf`): 4662 ok unit×cycle pairs
 * compared, **0 differences** in `atoms`/`spans`/`durs`; 19375 occurrences
 * retained against 19331 atoms after display dedupe, i.e. **44 occurrences the
 * old reader dropped**.
 *
 * RE-TAKEN (2026-08-03, at `c5d3f6f5`, same `b08326cf` baseline): 4703 pairs,
 * again **0 differences**; 21342 occurrences retained against 21284 atoms, i.e.
 * **58 dropped**. The pair and occurrence counts moved with the corpus, which
 * has grown since; the claim that matters — the two readers derive identical
 * `atoms`/`spans`/`durs` — still holds across everything that has landed since
 * #1034. This re-take is also what proves the skip below is not vacuous: the
 * instrument was armed once and observed to pass, not merely observed to skip.
 *
 * TO RE-RUN, materialize the old reader beside the new one first — it is not
 * committed, because a second copy of `parse.ts` in the tree is exactly the kind
 * of divergent oracle this suite exists to avoid:
 *
 *     git show b08326cf:packages/editor/src/visualEdit/notation/parse.ts \
 *       > packages/editor/src/visualEdit/notation/parseBASE.ts
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run \
 *       --config vitest.instruments.config.ts tests/parity-corpus/_sweep-1034e.spec.ts
 *     rm packages/editor/src/visualEdit/notation/parseBASE.ts
 *
 * (The old recipe renamed this to `_sweep-1034e.test.ts` first, because the gate
 * config includes `*.test.ts` only. `vitest.instruments.config.ts` — added with
 * #1141 — includes the `_*.spec.ts` instruments directly, so the rename is no
 * longer needed. Leave `parseBASE.ts` out of any commit.)
 *
 * The baseline is still reachable: `b08326cf` resolves, and `readGridOnsets` has
 * the same signature there as it does today, so this A/B is re-runnable — it is
 * waiting on the scratch copy, not on a reader that no longer exists.
 *
 * WHY IT SKIPS RATHER THAN FAILS (#1141). Without `parseBASE.ts` this used to die
 * mid-test on "Failed to load url … parseBASE. Does the file exist?", which reads
 * as a broken instrument rather than an unarmed one. It now detects the baseline
 * and declares the precondition instead. The honest cost: a skipped test is green
 * forever, and only the printed skip reason stands against that — weaker than a
 * passing assertion, and the shape #1062 warns about. It is the price of an
 * instrument whose oracle deliberately does not live in the tree.
