/**
 * structuralWalk resilience / reach gate — PV212 (#974, part of the collect.ts split #945).
 *
 * The whole point of keeping a structural walk (instead of routing lanes through the eval-backed
 * hap producer too) is RESILIENCE: syntactically-valid but semantically-invalid code — an
 * unresolved binding, a mid-edit trailing dot, a half-typed call — makes Strudel's `evaluate()`
 * THROW, so `getTimelineEvents` returns no haps and the eval-backed marks are empty. The timeline
 * must still draw its lane SKELETON so the editor doesn't blink to a blank canvas mid-keystroke
 * (never "24 events → 0 blank", spike §4). `structuralWalk` owns that skeleton, and its per-node
 * try/catch degrades a bad sub-node to its own branch instead of blanking the whole walk.
 *
 * This is the committed half of the two-arm gate (Arm B). Arm A — that the eval marks are the
 * correct verdict when evaluation SUCCEEDS — is a browser-fidelity check (headless over-counts,
 * P319), not this file. Here we assert only the structural floor: mid-edit code still has lanes.
