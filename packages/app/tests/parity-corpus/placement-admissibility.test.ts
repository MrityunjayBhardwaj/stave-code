/**
 * #1064 / #1070 — PROVE BEFORE OFFER, AT THE GESTURE.
 *
 * `op-admissibility.test.ts` (#1010 P4c) asserts this for every op and every
 * control-state function. It never covered the CELL — the interaction the panel
 * exists for — so a click on a cell whose result the writer cannot spell wrote
 * nothing, toggled nothing and said nothing. This is that gate, for placement.
 *
 * POPULATION (stated, per this boundary's standing rule that every gate names
 * its population, its comparison axes and its sampling depth):
 *   - every mini in `mini-corpus.json` that opens a step grid or a piano roll;
 *   - split by WRITE PATH — `leafSource` / `altSource` / `source` — because the
 *     same gesture on the same model has a different answer per path, and
 *     nothing in the model surfaces which one it is (#1070);
 *   - grid: every EMPTY cell of every lane. Roll: every (pitch, step) over the
 *     model's own content range, which is the range the panel displays.
 *   - the axis is PLACEMENT only (OFF→ON). Deletes, resizes and velocity are
 *     different ops with their own write paths and are not gated here.
 *
 * THE COMPARISON IS AGAINST AN INDEPENDENT ARM, not against itself. `canToggleCell`
 * is *derived* from `toggleCell`, so asking whether they agree is a tautology and
 * would read green forever ([[P370]] — a gate that cannot fail). The arm below
 * rebuilds the UNGATED toggle — the pre-#1064 shape — and asks the real writer
 * about its output. That is a deliberate second oracle used as a control, which
 * is the one use [[PV192]] permits: it exists to be compared against, never to
 * decide anything.

    // ⚠ THE LEAF FIGURE MOVED IN PHASE 3, AND THE SENTENCE THAT USED TO EXPLAIN
    // IT WAS FALSIFIED RATHER THAN OUTDATED. It read "byte surgery has no span
    // to create, so #1070 is untouched by this". A rest is real bytes with a
    // real span; it produced no hap, so nothing indexed it, and that — not the
    // nature of byte surgery — is why a leaf column took nothing. #1154 indexes
    // rests beside the anchors, so a column holding a `~` now has a span to
    // write through, and 248 of the 3,584 are placements the writer takes:
    // 3,584 → 3,336 refused, across 17 of the 82 leaf units.
    //
    // The scope this was approved under — "only the `~` WE just wrote, undoing
    // the user's own delete" — turned out not to exist. The model is re-read
    // from the document after every write, so nothing marks a rest as one this
    // writer produced, and there is no line of code that could tell the two
    // apart. The wide version is what the code can express and it is the one
    // that shipped: a rest's bytes swapped for a note is the most basic grid
    // edit there is, and every other write path already does it.
    //
    // ⚠ THE 31 ARE THE PREDICTED RESIDUAL, not a leftover. #1064 measured its
    // own population before any fix existed: of 1,748 declines, 1,717 (98.2%)
    // were "another lane sustaining through the clicked column" and "the
    // remaining 31 are other causes". The clamp removed exactly the 1,717 it
    // names and left exactly the 31 it does not.
    //
    // WHAT THEY ARE, classified rather than assumed, and now ASSERTED below rather
    // than only described: all 31 sit on MULTI-PART (`,`-stacked) units, over 9
    // distinct minis. So they are not this clamp's mechanism reappearing at the
    // edges; they are the part-relative causes `partColumns` owns, where a part
    // carries its own coarser resolution or a region (`sd(2,4,1)`, `[- cp]*2`)
    // cannot be re-emitted with an onset added.
    //
    // ⚠ THE "AND NOT ONE IS FRACTIONAL" CLAUSE WAS DROPPED, because it reported on
    // an empty set. Re-measured on this tree: the element path holds ZERO units with
    // a fractional cell length, so no refusal could have been fractional and the
    // clause was true without being evidence. (The detector was checked against
    // #1069's own example, `[bd _ _ _, ~ ~ hh ~]`, which does read fractional —
    // `bd@0.5 sd hh cp` is the WRONG control, since the reader raises the resolution
    // and hands back integral lengths.) Fractional lengths are #1069's subject and
    // they live on other paths.
    //
    // ⚠ UNITS DIFFER BY 8 ON THE ELEMENT PATH, and the CAUSE stated here was wrong
    // until it was measured: it is not "parseable models vs models that open a
    // placeable view". `mini-corpus.json` holds 1535 entries and 1527 distinct
    // minis, and this sweep maps them RAW while the committed sweep dedupes — the 8
    // are duplicate entries counted twice. They contribute zero asks (each is a grid

   * ONE RULE, BOTH SURFACES (#1064 phase 2) — a new onset ends every note that

   * scope.
   *
   * The roll has always done this: `placeNote` trims every note crossing the
   * click with NO pitch filter, so placing a note has always shortened whatever
   * else was sounding — including a different pitch, audibly, on the 42.7% of
   * routed units whose length the engine honours. The grid clamped only the lane
   * that was clicked, which is narrower than the notation it has to emit, and
   * that mismatch is #1064. They now agree, and this is the gate that keeps them
   * agreeing rather than a sentence in a commit message.
   *
   * ASSERTED AS A PROPERTY OF THE RESULT, not by comparing the two functions:
   * after any ACCEPTED placement, nothing sustains across the new onset. That
   * holds for both ops without either one knowing about the other, which is what
   * makes it a shared rule instead of a shared implementation.
   *
   * ⚠ ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS THE ROLL'S ALONE — found by this gate firing, not
   * predicted: `placeNote` returns early when a group already starts at the
   * clicked column (the note joins the chord and adopts its duration), and that
   * branch trims nothing. Excluding it takes the roll to zero violations, so the
   * chord-join branch is the WHOLE of the exception — measured by removing it and
   * watching the count go to zero, not assumed from reading the code.
   *
   * ⚠ WHAT THIS GATE CANNOT CATCH, stated so nobody reads it as broader than it
   * is: it inspects ACCEPTED placements only, so DELETING the clamp does not turn
   * it red — the placements simply become refusals and are skipped. That
   * regression is caught by the pinned per-path counts above (element would go
   * back to 1,748) and by the offer-vs-writer arm. This one catches a clamp that
   * trims the wrong thing, or not far enough while still being writable, which is
   * the failure the other two cannot see. All three were proven to fire.
   *
   * It is also legitimate rather than a second bug. A sustain across a column
   * that already carries an onset was there BEFORE the placement — the click did
   * not create the overlap — and the roll can express overlap in notation that
   * the grid cannot (parallel comma-lanes, #628), which is exactly why `resizeNote`
   * lets a roll note sustain under a later onset. The grid has no such spelling,
   * so its arm below carries no exception at all. Same rule, different notation
   * underneath it; the asymmetry is in the representation, and it is stated here
   * rather than smoothed over by weakening the grid's arm to match.

   * ⚠ THIS TEST NO LONGER ASKS A PATH QUESTION, and the rename is the finding.

   * It used to assert `viewPlacesNotes(model) === !model.leafSource` — a view-level
   * predicate PREDICTING the op, justified by "byte surgery has no span to create,
   * so a leaf view accepts nothing, by construction". #1154 gave rest columns a span
   * and the construction argument became false, at which point the prediction was
   * withholding the affordance on 248 cells the writer would have taken.
   *
   * So the claim is now the one that was always the point of asking at the view:
   * THE VIEW-LEVEL ANSWER AGREES WITH EVERY CELL ON THAT VIEW. That is what entitles
   * the panel to state it once instead of greying a surface with no reason on any of
   * it — and unlike the path rule, it cannot be falsified by the op's reach moving,
   * because it is derived from the op.
   *
   * ⚠ NOT A TAUTOLOGY, though it restates the function's own rule ([[P370]]). The
   * function EARLY-EXITS on the first acceptance and enumerates its own asks; this
   * arm counts every cell independently, so a wrong ask set or a wrong exit shows up
   * as a disagreement. Proven by breaking it: restoring `model.leafSource == null`
   * turns this red on the first leaf grid that takes a note.

   * #1163 — THE CHEAP PROBE MUST ANSWER WHAT THE WHOLE SURFACE ANSWERS.
   *
   * `viewPlacesNotes` decides whether the roll greys every empty cell, and it decides it
   * from a fraction of the surface: the model's own content rows plus ONE padded row,
   * over `model.steps` columns, skipping only the cells where a note STARTS. The panel
   * draws something else — every row of `rollContentRange`, `columnCount(model)` columns
   * (#1087), and a cell is held when a note OVERLAPS it (#1074). Four differences, and
   * until this arm existed nothing compared them: the probe's padded row was `min − 1`,
   * true only because `contentRange` padded by two, a constant that lived in
   * `PianoRollGrid.tsx` with no arm between them. Either could have moved alone.
   *
   * The extraction of `rollContentRange` removed the guess. This removes the rest of the
   * exposure, because reading the same range is not the same as sweeping the same cells:
   * the columns and the held-rule are still stated twice, and this is the arm that fails
   * when any of the four stops agreeing.
   *
   * ⚠ IT IS AN INDEPENDENT SWEEP, NOT A RE-CALL. It rebuilds the panel's ask-space from
   * `rollContentRange` / `columnCount` / `columnOverlap` and asks `canPlaceNote` directly,
   * so it is a second oracle used purely as a control — the one use [[PV192]] permits.
   * Comparing `viewPlacesNotes` against itself would be green forever ([[P370]]).
   *
   * ⚠ WHY THE PANEL IS NOT SIMPLY GIVEN THE WHOLE SURFACE, since that would make the arm
   * unnecessary: measured, it changes the answer on 0 of 544 corpus rolls and costs 7×
   * (p99 0.5 → 5.4ms, worst 2.5 → 18.0ms per view), which is the neighbourhood of the
   * per-cell map #1070 declined at 21.7ms. Paying that for no measured behaviour is the
   * wrong trade; pinning the equivalence costs nothing at runtime.
   *
   * ⚠ THE POPULATIONS ARE PINNED, not bounded, and on this corpus the PIN is the half
   * that does the work — measured, not assumed. Reconstructing the pre-#1163 tree (drop
   * the padding AND hardcode the probe back to `min − 1`) leaves every other arm in this
   * file green, which is exactly what the issue said: nothing could fail. Under that same
   * drift the equality below still holds, because the answer genuinely is invariant; what
   * moves is the size of the surface, so `fullSurfaceAsks` is what catches it. The
   * equality is here for the divergence that has not happened yet — a reach change that
   * makes one of the four axes stop being answer-neutral.
   *
   * ⚠ AND ONE AXIS IS UNEXERCISED, said rather than implied: `columnCount === model.steps`
   * on all 544 corpus rolls and the note-tail term (#1087) binds on 0 of them, so removing
   * that term leaves this arm green. It is covered in principle and untested in fact.
