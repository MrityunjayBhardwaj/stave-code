/**
 * cell-coverage.test.ts — the step grid DRAWS a note across the columns it covers
 * (#1056, Resolution Phase 3).
 *
 * WHY THIS GATE EXISTS, and why it is not `cell-duration.test.ts`. That gate asserts the
 * cell carries a length the engine played; this one asserts the panel turns that length
 * into columns. They are different subjects and they failed independently: the length
 * has been read (P4b) and preserved (P4c) since #1010 and was still invisible, because
 * every visual property of a cell derived from `isCellOn` and a sustained column is
 * `false` — `bd _ sd ~` and `bd ~ sd ~` drew an IDENTICAL picture ([[PV245]]).
 *
 * WHAT IS AND IS NOT CIRCULAR HERE — stated because the issue's first wording asked for
 * a comparison that could only agree with itself. Coverage is DERIVED from the cell
 * length, so re-checking a derived path's coverage against the haps it descends from
 * proves nothing. Four arms are real, and they are real in different ways:
 *   - SYNTACTIC path: lengths come from the AST slot span and never touch the engine, so
 *     an engine comparison is fully independent. Covers 3931 of 6207 drawn columns.
 *   - The DISTRIBUTION arithmetic on every path: conservation, disjointness, and the
 *     room rule are properties of `laneCoverage` alone, not of the length it was handed.
 *   - THE WRITER, reached through TEXT: `sustainTokens` answers the same covered-columns
 *     question in its own loop and spells it `_`, so comparing against the serialized
 *     document puts `laneCoverage` on one side of the comparison only. This is the arm
 *     that is non-circular on the DERIVED paths too, and it runs in both directions
 *     across two tests — see each for the direction it can and cannot see.
 *   - RESOLUTION INVARIANCE, on the shipped ×2 op: what the user sees must not change
 *     when the grid is viewed twice as fine.
 * Reported separately rather than pooled into one green.
 *
 * THE CONTROL ARM THE PHASE OWES ([[PV232]] — a control must be reported, not assumed).
 * #1056's "at 1× the layout is identical" is asserted STRUCTURALLY, not sampled: the
 * set of columns that are a coverage HEAD is exactly the set of ON cells, corpus-wide.
 * That is what makes this change additive — it can light columns that were dark and
 * narrow a bar that was full, and it can never move, add or drop a trigger.
 *
 * AND THE GATE MUST BE ABLE TO FIRE ([[P353]]): a degenerate coverage that draws every
 * note as exactly its own full column — which is precisely the pre-#1056 behaviour — is
 * run through the same comparisons and MUST be caught. If it is not, the phase changed
 * nothing.
 *
 * THE k = 2 / k = 4 ARMS the issue asks for run here, on `scaleStepGrid(m, 'double')` —
 * the SHIPPED ×2 op, which doubles the column count and every cell length exactly as a
 * finer view would. They were first reported as blocked on #1055's view multiple; that
 * was one option too many. When #1055 lands, its parameter is a second input to the same
 * comparison, not a reason this one could not be made.

    // showable the moment there is one.
