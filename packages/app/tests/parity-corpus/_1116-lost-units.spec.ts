/**
 * _1116-lost-units.spec.ts — PROBE (inert: `_` prefix + `.spec.ts`).
 *
 * THE UNASKED QUESTION from #1057's denominator work: between the pinned pre-#1047 copy
 * and the live tree, the grid's opening population moved 968 → 958, with element
 * 896 → 876 and leaf 72 → 82. An element-only count reports that as "-20" and cannot
 * tell a REALLOCATION (element unit now served by the leaf writer — no reach lost) from
 * a LOSS (unit stops opening at all). The path split says 10 of each. This probe names
 * the 10 losses and asks the live tree WHY it refuses each one.
 *
 * The suspicion on record is that they are the deliberate refusals — `leafViewUsable` /
 * prove-before-offer, i.e. views that opened but offered nothing a user could act on.
 * That is a hypothesis, not a finding, and it is what this measures.
 *
 * ⚠ THE BASE IS A WHOLE-MODULE SNAPSHOT. Everything that landed in parse/model/
 * resolution/serialize since #1047 is folded into any difference, so this attributes to
 * a REASON STRING and a gate, never to a single issue. Naming the reason is what makes
 * the next step decidable.
