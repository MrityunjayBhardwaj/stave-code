/**
 * _1235-width-coincidence.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT. Is [[PV319]]'s ÷2 coincidence reachable
 * on the overlay as it ships today, or only under #1233's core attachment?
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1235-width-coincidence.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * THE MECHANISM. `anchorsDescribe` admits an overlay when the anchored width equals the
 * model's — two numbers derived by different code from different premises. A restructure
 * that lands the model's width ON the overlay's therefore passes a guard that was meant
 * to say "this is still the model those spans were read from". The write then puts the
 * PRE-restructure bytes back and the user's ÷2 silently does nothing.
 *
 * A HIT is: the resolution op applies (the model's width changes), the leaf writer
 * answers, and the bytes it returns are the ORIGINAL document. Asked of the real ops
 * (`scaleStepGrid` / `scalePianoRoll`, which are what the ÷2 control calls) and the real
 * writers, over three carriers, so the answer separates "ships today" from "#1233 only".
 *
 * ⚠ THE SIMULATED ARM MODELS THE ATTACHMENT `withSurgery` PERFORMS, which RE-STAMPS the
 * attached width for the model the spans are landing on. Attaching naively — spreading
 * the leaf projection's source through unchanged — leaves the field describing the LEAF
 * model and reintroduces exactly the defect, which is why both arms are reported: the
 * gap between them is the measure of how load-bearing the re-stamp is, and it is the one
 * thing #1233 must not get wrong when it attaches on the core path.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ SINCE #1233 SHIPPED, THE `simulated` AND `naive` ARMS ARE VACUOUS AND THE `shipping`
 * ARM IS THE MEASUREMENT. Every model now carries an overlay, so the `else if (spans)`
 * branch those two arms live in is never reached and they print `0 of 0` — which reads
 * like "nothing swallowed" and means "nothing asked". Read the DENOMINATOR, not the count.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND THE SIMULATION UNDER-REPORTED WHILE IT WAS LIVE. It attached spans fetched from
 * `projectStepGridDerived`, which carry the DERIVED path's `attachedSteps` — a stamp that
 * usually disagrees with the core model they were being pasted onto, so the simulated
 * overlay was refused for a reason the real attachment never has. It read 2 grid + 2 roll;
 * breaking the re-stamp on the BUILT change reads 13 + 2. The lesson outlives this file: a
 * simulation that does not reproduce the field the guard reads is not measuring the guard,
 * and the number it produces is confidently wrong rather than obviously missing.
