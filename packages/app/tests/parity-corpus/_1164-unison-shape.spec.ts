/**
 * _1164-unison-shape.spec.ts — PROBE (inert). WHAT SHAPE ARE THE 24?
 *
 * #1164 is settled as to CAUSE (`after` is a SET, so a unison's twin keeps the pitch
 * present and nothing enters `gone`) and unsettled as to FIX. The issue names two
 * candidates and declines to choose: carry the multiplicity (make the pitch comparison a
 * multiset, as the DURATION check at the same site already is), or refuse.
 *
 * Carrying the multiplicity is only well defined if the writer can say WHICH anchor the
 * user dropped. Two `,`-stacked parts at one column and one pitch have two disjoint leaf
 * spans; blanking the wrong one writes a different document. The duration multiset check
 * immediately above already distinguishes anchors by length, so:
 *
 *   - unison pair with DISTINCT durations  → the dropped note is identifiable, the fix is
 *                                            determined, and the existing check already
 *                                            computes the matching
 *   - unison pair with EQUAL durations     → the two anchors are interchangeable in the
 *                                            model; either choice is audibly identical and
 *                                            produces a DIFFERENT document. That is a
 *                                            coin flip written into the user's file.
 *
 * The split between those two decides whether "carry the multiplicity" is a principled
 * fix or an arbitrary one, so it is measured before anything is proposed. Measured, not
 * argued: reading the site cannot say how the real corpus is distributed.
 *
 * ⚠ READ `_1164-panel-gesture.spec.ts` FIRST — IT OVERTAKES THIS ONE. The split below is
 * real, and it is a fact about a gesture nobody performs. `PianoRollGrid` deletes by CELL,
 * removing every note at a (pitch, start); a unison is two notes sharing exactly that key,
 * so the real click removes both and the pitch leaves the comparison normally. Over the
 * corpus, the panel's gesture produces ZERO silent no-ops. Everything here is measured
 * by-index, which is #1164's own model and not the app's.
 *
 * Kept because the population figures are still the ones a fix would have to move, and
 * because the 28-vs-24 reconciliation (the issue inherited #1160's shared-leaf filter,
 * which is not this cause) is worth not re-deriving.
