/**
 * free-zone-equivalence.test.ts — #1057's done-when, as an EQUIVALENCE rather than
 * an absence.
 *
 * The phase's claim is that refining the grid stopped rewriting the document. The
 * tempting gate for that is "the document did not change" — and it is worthless on
 * its own, because a control that does nothing at all satisfies it perfectly. This
 * codebase has already shipped exactly that failure once: after #1010 P4c the ÷2
 * button stayed clickable and inert on 24 of 24 units with the whole suite green,
 * because the control's state was PREDICTED instead of asked. So the issue states
 * two clauses and calls the second non-optional:
 *
 *   1. the document is byte-identical before and after, AND
 *   2. the rendered layout EQUALS what the old rewriting path would have produced.
 *
 * Clause 2 is what makes clause 1 mean something. Together they say: you see the
 * same grid you always saw, and your file was not touched to give it to you.
 *
 * ── HOW EACH CLAUSE IS ACTUALLY OBSERVED ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Clause 1 is asserted with its own control arm. "Nothing was written" is only
 * informative where there WAS a write to prevent, so every unit counted must be
 * shown to have been rewritten by the old path — `serialize(oldPath(model))` differs
 * from the source mini. A unit whose old path happened to be a no-op proves nothing
 * and is excluded by name rather than silently passing.
 *
 * Clause 2 compares LAYOUTS, not references: the model the panel now draws
 * (`parse(mini, scale)`) against the model the old path would have written
 * (`scaleTo(model, target)`), canonicalized so lane order and absent optionals
 * cannot make two identical grids compare unequal.
 *
 * ── THE THREE BUCKETS, AND WHY `gained` IS NOT SWEPT UNDER `equivalent` ────────
 * The old path can DECLINE (`ifGridSpellable`) where the view draws happily. Those
 * units have no old layout to be equivalent to, so folding them into the pass count
 * would be counting a missing comparison as a successful one. They are reported
 * separately as reach the free zone adds.
 *
 *   equivalent — old path wrote a layout, and the view draws that same layout
 *   gained     — old path declined; the view draws something it could not
 *   divergent  — old path wrote a layout and the view draws a DIFFERENT one  ← must be 0
 *
 * ⚠ POPULATION. Element units only, matching the denominator #1057 is scoped
 * against ([[PV261]]: the leaf path offers no resolution op at all, and the user's
 * call was to leave it disabled). Pinned on this tree at grid 2967 / roll 1241
 * free-zone offers — re-measured, not inherited ([[P416]]).
