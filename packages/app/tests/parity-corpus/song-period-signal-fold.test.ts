/**
 * song-period-signal-fold — what #1465 CHANGED, measured against the frozen
 * pre-decision state.
 *
 * The rule: at the cap, ask the identity question WITHOUT the dimensions the
 * document's own source says are continuously modulated, then fold the excluded
 * signals' own rates back in so the answer is a period the AUDIO honours.
 * `songAnalysis.signalInformedPeriod` carries the argument; this file carries
 * the consequence.
 *
 * ── IT PRICED A CANDIDATE; IT NOW PINS A SHIPPED RULE ────────────────────────
 * While the decision was open this swept an injected candidate against the LIVE
 * baseline. The rule shipped, so the candidate and production are the same thing
 * and that comparison would read "0 changed" forever. It is now the shape its
 * sibling `song-period-abstention.test.ts` uses: sweep the DEFAULT detector —
 * production, reached through `AnalyzeSongOptions.signals` exactly as the app
 * passes it — and compare against the same tree swept WITHOUT the rule: a detector
 * that asks `displayPeriodRule` exactly what production asks, minus `signals`.
 *
 * ⚠ IT USED TO COMPARE AGAINST `SONG-PERIOD-BASELINE-PRE-1465.json`, frozen at the
 * state the decision was made in, and that stopped isolating the rule the moment
 * anything BENEATH it changed (#1617). Rounding the cycle fingerprint's values let
 * swept tracks repeat, which moved documents this file then charged to #1465 —
 * `0/-1poFQwaznQK` 32->48 read as "changed below the cap" and "lengthened", two
 * things the rule cannot do. Sweeping both arms on one tree holds every property
 * below true by construction, whatever the fingerprint is. The frozen file is kept
 * as the record of the state #1465 was decided in.
 *
 * ── WHY THE ASSERTIONS ARE ABOUT THE INSTRUMENT, NOT THE VERDICT ─────────────
 * Kept from the pricing form, because the properties are what make the numbers
 * trustworthy rather than what makes the rule good:
 *
 *  1. the denominator (a document dropping silently out of the sweep would make
 *     every count below look better than it is);
 *  2. the structural properties the rule must have if it is the rule it claims
 *     to be. It runs only on the branch where production found NOTHING, so it
 *     can only ever ADD a period — it may not change a document that resolved
 *     below the cap, may not destroy a period, and may not lengthen one. All
 *     three are impossible by construction, which is exactly why they are
 *     asserted: a failure here means the rule is no longer the rule described.
 *
 * The recovery COUNT is pinned too, unlike in the pricing form — it is a
 * shipped behaviour now, and a refactor that quietly stopped folding or stopped
 * excluding should read as red rather than as a smaller number in a log.
 *
 * ⚠ THE REPORT IS PRINTED BEFORE THE ASSERTIONS, deliberately. The first run of
 * the pricing form tripped an assertion and the measurement was lost with it,
 * which is the one failure mode a file like this cannot afford.
