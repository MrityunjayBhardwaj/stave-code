/**
 * _1260-term3-delta.spec.ts — MEASURE THE WIRING BEFORE PRODUCTION MOVES (#1260).
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1260-term3-delta.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * #1256 sized term 3 (154 units on the 150-tune corpus, 15 on the vendored one).
 * This file answers the two questions that sizing does not, and that the wiring
 * cannot be judged without:
 *
 *  1. WHAT EACH GATE READS. Three `.test.ts` gates ask `status === 'note'` and
 *     mean three different questions by it — "the coverage number's numerator",
 *     "this unit's content span is known", "no view opens on this unit". Term 3
 *     belongs to the first and to neither of the others, so the per-gate
 *     direction has to be predicted per QUESTION, not per status string
 *     ([[P572]]: ask what each rule is indexed by before agreeing they are two
 *     versions of one thing). The table below is that prediction, computed.
 *
 *  2. WHAT THE PREDICATE OVER-EXCLUDES. `hasStructure`'s grid clause is
 *     `steps > 1 && hits >= 1`, so a grid with SIX lanes in ONE column —
 *     `sound("hh, hh, hh, bd, hh, rd")` — is called unstructured while offering
 *     six togglable cells. That is more than one thing to edit by any reading.
 *     The count is reported here rather than assumed to be zero, because a
 *     stated limit with no number beside it is the shape #1046 is about.
 *
 * ⚠ IT SURVIVES ITS OWN SUBJECT, and that took one deliberate decision. The
 * population is selected with `hasKnownContent` — "a view opened and the string
 * round-tripped" — not with `status === 'note'`. Written the second way this
 * file would have measured 154 units before the wiring and 0 after, and the
 * zero would have read as a clean result rather than as the instrument losing
 * the ability to disagree. Holding the population fixed is what makes the
 * before/after a pair: every figure below must be IDENTICAL on both sides of
 * the change, and the last block asserts the oracle's own count against it.
