/**
 * _p4e-core-overlay.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT, not a gate. What P4d's overlay would buy
 * on the half it has not been applied to: the CORE-OPENED units, which still write
 * through the region splice (`splice 805 · leaf 103 · alt 53` on the shipping tree).
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_p4e-core-overlay.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * WHAT IT ASKS, and why this order. #1010's remaining half is "attach the overlay on
 * the core path too", and the axis the deciding gate cannot score is the one that
 * decides whether it is worth anything at all: the region splice ALREADY copies every
 * byte outside the touched element, so a unit whose element IS the note re-emits the
 * same bytes surgery would have written. Counting how many of the 805 would come back
 * DIFFERENT is the benefit; anything else is the cost of a second projection.
 *
 * ⚠ IT ASKS THE MECHANISM RATHER THAN RESTATING IT. The spans come from
 * `projectStepGridDerived`, which is the function `withSurgery` reads them out of, and
 * the verdict comes from `serializeStepGridWithExtent`, which is the writer itself. The
 * one thing modelled here is the ATTACHMENT (`{ ...model, surgical: spans }`) — three
 * lines, and precisely the candidate change, so the probe measures the change rather
 * than a description of it.
 *
 * ⚠ VALIDATED AGAINST THE COMMITTED GATE'S OWN PUBLISHED NUMBERS before any of its
 * treatment readings are believed ([[PK90]] step 4): units 981, asked 961, and the
 * by-path split 103/805/53 are asserted here. A drift in those means the corpus or the
 * writer moved and every figure below describes a different population.
