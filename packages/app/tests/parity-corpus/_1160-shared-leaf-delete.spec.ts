/**
 * _1160-shared-leaf-delete.spec.ts — PROBE (inert: `_` prefix + `.spec.ts`).
 *
 * CAN YOU DELETE AT ALL ON A LEAF SURFACE? Measured over the whole corpus, on BOTH
 * surfaces, with the refusal site read off the run rather than guessed from the source.
 *
 * #1160 records the grid's half at 275 of 557 asks refusing at `shared-leaf-disagrees`.
 * Two reasons that figure is re-derived here rather than quoted:
 *
 *  - It was measured while diagnosing #1154, on a tree whose writer has since changed
 *    what it can SPELL (rests are now indexed, so a column that had no span has one).
 *    A rate taken before that change describes a writer that no longer exists.
 *  - The issue's own scope line says the ROLL's half was never measured at all. A
 *    design call about whether to split shared tokens rests on both numbers or neither.
 *
 * THE GESTURE, on each surface, exactly as the panel poses it:
 *   grid — open the grid, click one sounding cell OFF, ask the writer
 *   roll — open the roll, drop one note, ask the writer
 * One ask per sounding cell / per note. No re-open, no re-add: this probe is about
 * step one alone, which is what makes it a different question from #1154's.
 *
 * WHAT A SPLIT WOULD COST is measured, not estimated: for every refusal, the shared
 * token is read back out of `leafSource.src` and reported with how many columns it
 * backs. That turns "we would have to re-spell `bd*4`" from a worry into a population.
 *
 * ⚠ REQUIRES TEMPORARY INSTRUMENTATION. `serialize.ts` ships with none. Each `return
 * null` inside `spliceByLeaf`/`spliceRollByLeaf` must be wrapped in a helper that bumps
 * `globalThis.__leafRefusals[why]`; restore the file by checksum afterwards. Without it
 * every refusal reads as an undifferentiated `leaf`, which is the blunt answer three
 * issues in a row have already been misled by.
