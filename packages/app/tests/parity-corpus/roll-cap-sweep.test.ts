/**
 * roll-cap-sweep.test.ts — the piano roll's leaf period cap, measured on BOTH of the
 * populations it governs, reported separately and never netted (#1020).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `LEAF_PROJECT_BARS.roll` was set to 4 by a sweep at 4/6/8/12/16
 * that showed exactly zero gain at every value. That sweep ran through
 * `writer-reach.test.ts`, whose population is one line — `if (core.ok) continue`. So it
 * asked "does raising the roll's cap help the patterns the syntactic core REFUSES?" and
 * the honest answer was no. **A gate defined as another gate's complement carries a
 * population restriction that none of its numbers mention** ([[P345]]): the other half —
 * the 414 roll asks the core SERVES — was never swept, and there the same cap is the
 * single largest blocker on the reach the core is the sole provider of.
 *
 * So this gate sweeps both:
 *
 *   POPULATION A — core-REFUSED (`parsePianoRollCore` says no).  `writer-reach`'s
 *                  population. What a cap raise BUYS on top of what already ships.
 *   POPULATION B — core-SERVED (`parsePianoRollCore` says yes).  The writer census's
 *                  population. What a cap raise SAVES when the core is deleted (#1012).
 *
 * They are reported as two numbers with their populations named. A single netted figure
 * is the exact error this file was filed to undo, and it would hide the finding: the two
 * populations move in opposite directions because they are made of different notation —
 * A's long-period roll patterns are `!n`/`@n` REPETITIONS whose notes share one source
 * atom, B's are branch ALTERNATIONS whose notes each own their token.
 *
 * REACH IS NOT ENOUGH, AND THAT IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE ORIGINAL DECISION. The cap was
 * left at 4 partly because the views a raise opened were only **13–58% live** — a roll
 * where almost nothing the user drags moves reads as broken, which is worse than an
 * honest refusal ([[PV222]]). So every view this reports carries `liveness` (the
 * fraction of its cleanly-singleton notes whose own delete round-trips through the
 * engine) and `structured` (more than one note — a one-note roll is a correct model and
 * a useless surface). `liveness` comes from `engineEditOracle.ts`, so the sweep and the
 * reach gate cannot disagree about what "an edit survived" means; `structured` comes
 * from `notation/model.ts`'s `hasStructure`, so this sweep and the writer census cannot
 * disagree about what "worth showing" means (#1259 — it used to be spelled here, which
 * is what that sentence originally papered over by naming one source for both).
 *
 * HOW A SWEEP IS RUN. The cap is a module constant, deliberately — it is a shipped
 * bound, not a knob, and threading a parameter through the writer to sweep it would mean
 * measuring a code path production never takes. To sweep, set the constant, run this
 * file, repeat. `scripts/roll-cap-sweep.mjs` drives that and diffs the emitted rows PER
 * ASK, which is what makes "additive only" checkable rather than assertable.
 *
 * The cap this run measured is READ BACK OUT OF THE SHIPPED REFUSAL SENTENCE rather than
 * taken from the environment: a sweep that labels its rows from its own driver can
 * silently attribute one cap's numbers to another, and an instrument's label is exactly
 * the kind of claim that has been wrong here before ([[P347]]).
 *
 * ⚠ THE MACHINERY MOVED TO `capSweep.ts` AT #1041, when the grid got the same treatment.
 * Nothing about this measurement changed in that move — the sweep, the report, the
 * artifact and the table are the same code, now taking a surface. What did NOT move is
 * the reading: the two halves of `LEAF_PROJECT_BARS` govern populations that respond to
 * it differently, so the sentences interpreting these numbers live below rather than in
 * the shared module. See the population-B floor in particular.

    // served by the ELEMENT writer and 16 by the leaf writer** — and this cap governs only
    // the leaf. So this floor, unlike A's, is not a guard on the constant this file
