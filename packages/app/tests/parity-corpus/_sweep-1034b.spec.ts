/**
 * _sweep-1034b — the COST arm of the #1034 sweep. Measurement only.
 *
 * The first arm found WHICH units collapse (4 of 1169 grid-readable). This arm
 * asks the only question that can move a number: are those units currently
 * COUNTED as writer-reach? Option (a) — record the multiset, writer refuses on
 * disagreement — turns every counted one into a refusal, and "writer-reach moves"
 * is a declared stop condition. A choice made without this is a choice made blind.
