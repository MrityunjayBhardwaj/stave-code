/**
 * capSweep.ts — one leaf period cap sweep, parameterised by the surface it measures.
 * Extracted at its SECOND use (#1041), the move `generatedDoc.ts` made at #1270.
 *
 * WHAT WAS DUPLICATED. `LEAF_PROJECT_BARS` is one declaration with two fields, and only
 * the roll's had a sweep: a driver that sets the real constant, a gate that reads its own
 * cap back out of the shipped refusal sentence, two populations reported alone, a per-ask
 * artifact, and a generated table with an expiry stamp. The grid's justification was a
 * figure in a comment, and that figure was wrong by nearly a factor of two the one time
 * anyone re-took it (#1038). Everything in this file is the part of that machinery that
 * does not care which surface it is pointed at.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ WHAT IS DELIBERATELY *NOT* HERE, AND WHY THE DESCRIPTOR CARRIES PROSE ([[PV338]]).
 * The two halves of one constant govern populations that respond to it completely
 * differently. The roll's core-SERVED population reads 369 transfers at cap 4, 3, 2 AND 1
 * — only 16 of its 415 opened views are leaf-served, so the constant barely reaches it,
 * and #1270 had to record that the roll's B floor "is not a guard on the constant this
 * file sweeps". The grid's B has 74 of 820 leaf-served and moves 717 → 727. Copying that
 * sentence into the grid arm would understate a guard that works.
 *
 * So the SHAPE is shared and the READING is not. Every number below is derived from the
 * run; every sentence that interprets one is supplied by the surface. A finding about one
 * half transfers to the other only by measurement.
