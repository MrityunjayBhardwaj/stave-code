/**
 * editCoverage.ts — the view-editability ORACLE, extracted so it can be gated.
 *
 * This is the measurement core `edit-coverage.spec.ts` runs in both its corpus
 * and live-Bakery modes. It lives in its own hermetic module (no vitest, no
 * env, no fs) for one reason: a `.spec.ts` is maintainer-only and never runs in
 * CI, so while the oracle lived inside it NOTHING guarded editability against
 * regression. `parity.test.ts` gates the timeline parser (`ir/parseStrudel`);
 * nothing gated `visualEdit/notation/parse.ts`, and the 55-fixture corpus was
 * the only thing that ever caught a real editability regression.
 *
 * Importing this module — rather than re-deriving the verdict — is the point:
 * a second copy of the oracle would answer confidently and diverge silently,
 * which is the failure this corpus exists to detect.
 *
 * Consumers:
 *   - `edit-coverage.spec.ts` — corpus + live measurement, writes the reports
 *   - `edit-parity.test.ts`   — the CI gate: per-fixture verdicts, snapshotted
