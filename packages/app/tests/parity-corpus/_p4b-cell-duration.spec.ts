/**
 * _p4b-cell-duration.spec.ts — MEASUREMENT ONLY, no product code, excluded from
 * the gate (`vitest.config.ts` includes `*.test.ts` only).
 *
 * QUESTION (#1010 P4b, asked BEFORE writing the product change): when the step
 * cell starts carrying a LENGTH, what lengths will it have to carry?
 *
 * Two things are being observed, and they are different:
 *
 *  1. THE UNIT. `Onset.durs` is in CYCLES. The cell's consumers reason in COLUMNS
 *     (`resolution.ts`, `resize.ts`, and — P4c — the printer), and `RollNote.duration`
 *     is already "length in columns". So the conversion at the read boundary is
 *     `dur_columns = dur_cycles * perBar`. This sweep prints the resulting
 *     distribution: how many cells last exactly their column, how many less, how
 *     many more. A cell population that is entirely `1` would mean the axis is
 *     carrying nothing and P4c has nothing to preserve.
 *
 *  2. THE TWO PATHS. The syntactic core walks the AST and knows a slot's SPAN in
 *     columns; the derived projection reads haps and knows a length in cycles.
 *     If they disagree about the same unit's lengths, they would populate one
 *     field with two different meanings — a finding, not a detail. The sweep
 *     reports them separately so the comparison is possible at all.
 *
 * NOT A SECOND ORACLE ([[PV192]]): the lengths come from the ENGINE (`queryArc`),
 * read exactly the way `readRollNotes` and `Onset.durs` read them
 * (`whole.end - whole.begin`). Nothing here re-implements a reader; the shipped
 * `parseStepGrid` supplies the model and the column count.
 *
 * SAMPLING DEPTH ([[P359]]): 16 cycles, the width the conservation gate converged
 * at. Printed with the figures, and sampled at 8 as well so a depth restriction
 * would show up as a disagreement instead of hiding.
