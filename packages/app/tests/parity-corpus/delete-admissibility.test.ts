/**
 * #1160 — THE DELETE A LEAF SURFACE REFUSES, PINNED ON BOTH SURFACES.
 *
 * `placement-admissibility.test.ts` states its axis as "PLACEMENT only (OFF→ON).
 * Deletes, resizes and velocity are different ops with their own write paths and are
 * not gated here." That was accurate and it left the delete ungated, which is how a
 * refusal affecting half of every leaf ask went four issues without a number.
 *
 * WHAT IS PINNED, and why a pin rather than a bound: about half of every delete
 * offered on a leaf surface is refused, and that is CORRECT — one token backing
 * several columns cannot be made to say two things at once, and letting the last
 * writer win would silently blank cells the user never touched. The refusal is not a
 * defect to be driven to zero. It is a stated property of the surface, and what a
 * stated property needs is an arm that notices when it changes SIZE, in either
 * direction. A `toBeLessThan` would let the rate double unnoticed; a `toBeGreaterThan`
 * would let the refusals quietly vanish into a writer that started guessing.
 *
 * POPULATION (per this boundary's rule that a gate names its population, its axes and
 * its depth):
 *   - every mini in `mini-corpus.json` that opens a step grid with a lane, or a piano
 *     roll with a note;
 *   - split by WRITE PATH — `leafSource` / `altSource` / `source` — because the same
 *     gesture has a different answer per path and nothing in the model surfaces which
 *     one is serving it (#1070);
 *   - grid: every SOUNDING cell of every lane, cleared one at a time. Roll: every CELL
 *     holding a note — a (pitch, start) — cleared one at a time, which removes every note
 *     there. One ask = one delete a user could actually pose, and that is a CLICK, so both
 *     surfaces are posed the way their panel poses them (#1168). The roll was posed by
 *     note index until then, which is not a gesture `PianoRollGrid` performs and differs
 *     from it on exactly the unisons — 14 asks, and the whole of the falsified #1164.
 *   - the axis is DELETE only. Placement is gated next door; resize and velocity have
 *     their own write paths and are not gated here either.
 *
 * THE COUNT IS NOT ASSERTED ALONE. Pinning 275 lets the same 275 arrive from a
 * different cause and read as unchanged — the failure mode the placement gate names in
 * its own docstring. So each refusal is also checked against an INDEPENDENT arm: the
 * shared-leaf predicate recomputed from `leafSource` directly, never from the writer's
 * answer. If the writer ever refuses for a new reason the count can stay put and this
 * still breaks.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ROLL'S HALF WAS UNMEASURED WHEN #1160 WAS FILED, and its scope line said so.
 * It turns out to carry the same branch at the same rate, so the population is 563
 * asks across the two surfaces rather than the 275 the issue records (551 while the roll
 * was posed by note; 563 once it is posed by cell, which refuses 12 of the 14 it had been
 * counting as accepted).
