/**
 * grid-cap-sweep.test.ts — the step grid's leaf period cap, measured on BOTH of the
 * populations it governs, reported separately and never netted (#1041).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. `LEAF_PROJECT_BARS` is one declaration with two fields and only
 * the roll's half had a gate. The grid's 12 was justified by a figure in a doc comment —
 * "+17 writer-reach over the 1500-unit corpus (109 → 126)" — and every time anyone
 * re-took that figure it had moved: it was recorded at #991 as "+9 (95 → 104)".
 *
 * ⚠⚠ AND THE HEADLINE WAS STILL EXACT WHILE BOTH FIGURES UNDER IT HAD DRIFTED. Re-measured
 * on this tree the GAIN is still the same digit and neither endpoint is. A delta is
 * precisely the shape a population change preserves — #1242 moved both terms by nearly the
 * same amount — so the number most likely to be quoted is the one least likely to look
 * stale, and a reader who spot-checks the gain walks away having certified two wrong
 * endpoints. That is why the comment on the constant now points at this gate instead of
 * carrying the number, and why today's pair is not written out here either: the floor
 * below is asserted, and the rest is in the generated table.
 *
 * THE TWO POPULATIONS, the same carve the roll sweep uses:
 *
 *   POPULATION A — core-REFUSED (`parseStepGridCore` says no).  `writer-reach`'s
 *                  population. What the cap BUYS on top of what already ships.
 *   POPULATION B — core-SERVED (`parseStepGridCore` says yes).  The writer census's
 *                  population. What the cap SAVES when the core is deleted (#1012).
 *
 * They are reported as two numbers with their populations named. A single netted figure is
 * the error that set the ROLL's cap to 4 on one population's null result read as general
 * ([[P345]]), and it is cheap enough to repeat that this file refuses to net them.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ BOTH OF THIS SURFACE'S POPULATIONS MOVE, AND THE ROLL'S B DOES NOT — do not carry the
 * roll's reading across. `roll-cap-sweep.test.ts` records that its own B floor "is not a
 * guard on the constant this file sweeps", because only 16 of the roll's 415 opened B views
 * are leaf-served and this cap governs only the leaf writer. The grid's B has **74 of 820**
 * leaf-served, and it moves. Both floors below therefore carry a real paired differential,
 * which the roll's B floor could not ([[PV338]]).
 *
 * HOW A SWEEP IS RUN. The cap is a module constant, deliberately — it is a shipped bound,
 * not a knob, and threading a parameter through the writer to sweep it would mean measuring
 * a code path production never takes. To sweep, set the constant, run this file, repeat.
 * `scripts/roll-cap-sweep.mjs grid 4 6 8 10 12` drives that and diffs the emitted rows PER
 * ASK, which is what makes "additive only" checkable rather than assertable.
 *
 * The cap this run measured is READ BACK OUT OF THE SHIPPED REFUSAL SENTENCE rather than
 * taken from the environment ([[P347]]) — and the grid needs its own probe pattern for it,
 * because the roll's plays numbers and this surface refuses those before the period gate is
 * ever reached ([[PK99]]).
