/**
 * detector-coverage.test.ts — the harness must ask EVERY shipped editor (#1003).
 *
 * `editCoverage.ts` decides a unit's editability by consulting a hand-written
 * set of detectors. That set was correct when it was written and then the
 * product grew: `detectMasterAll` shipped, nothing tied the two together, and
 * sixteen units that the app can edit today reported as `code-only` — a bucket
 * everyone reads as "no view exists" when it only ever meant "none of the
 * detectors this file happens to import said yes."
 *
 * This is the sibling of `denominator-audit.test.ts`, on the other half of the
 * fraction: that one guards what may leave the denominator, this one guards
 * that nothing shipped is missing from the numerator. As there, the direction
 * that costs us is the load-bearing one — a detector may only be listed as NOT
 * consulted with a stated reason, so the escape hatch cannot quietly become
 * "whatever we haven't got round to."
