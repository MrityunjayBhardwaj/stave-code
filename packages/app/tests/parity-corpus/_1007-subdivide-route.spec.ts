/**
 * _1007-subdivide-route.spec.ts — THROWAWAY INSTRUMENT. Does "subdividing authors"
 * depend on the ROUTE, rather than on the gesture?
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1007-subdivide-route.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * THE QUESTION, and why the previous answer is not yet safe to quote.
 * `_1007-subdivide-locality.spec.ts` measured "subdivide, then place into a slot the
 * source never indexed" and found the write moves p50 0.987 of a document >= 40 chars.
 * That probe reaches the refined model through `scaleStepGrid(model, 'double')` — and
 * `scaleStepGrid` HAS NO PRODUCTION CALLER outside `resolution.ts` itself. The panel
 * takes a different road: `SequencerGrid.tsx:99` wires `collapseToDocument`, and
 * `ResolutionControl` puts every target at or above the document count in a FREE ZONE
 * where nothing is written at all (#1057).
 *
 * So there are two roads to the same musical result, and only one is shipped:
 *
 *   ROUTE A (shipped)   parseStepGrid(mini, k)   -> toggleCell -> collapseStepGridToDocument
 *                       -> serializeStepGridWithExtent
 *                       The refined model is a VIEW of the document and carries the
 *                       source description with it.
 *   ROUTE B (probe)     scaleStepGrid(m,'double') -> toggleCell
 *                       -> serializeStepGridWithExtent
 *                       A model-space rescale. No collapse guard is asked, and the
 *                       source description does not survive the rescale.
 *
 * A cost measured on B is a fact about B. Whether it is also a fact about the product
 * is exactly what nothing on hand can say, because both existing instruments are
 * scoped to one road: the locality probe only ever drove B, and
 * `1058-refined-placement.test.ts` only ever drives A — and it EXCLUDES the population
 * where the whole line is re-derived (`:409-413`, `regions > 1` only), because that is
 * "the element writer's known bound rather than this phase's property". Neither is
 * wrong; neither answers this. [[P608]]'s shape one level down: a cost quoted about a
 * GESTURE, measured through a MECHANISM.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED. Only the document, and with the SAME `changedWidth` the locality
 * probe and `_1233-byte-change.spec.ts` use — copied rather than re-derived so the
 * three runs are directly comparable. Never "did it author", which would re-decide
 * what the writer decided ([[P519]]).
 *
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR, both columns written BEFORE the run ([[P527]], [[PV347]]):
 *
 *                          ROUTE IS THE CAUSE          GESTURE IS THE CAUSE
 *   A vs B, same units     A far below B               A comparable to B
 *   A vs leaf anchor       comparable                  far above
 *
 * PAIRED, NOT TWO SWEEPS. Only units where BOTH routes posed the gesture are compared,
 * so the difference cannot be a population difference ([[P546]] — an anchor taken on
 * other units is not an anchor). The unpaired remainder is reported, never dropped.
 *
 * CALIBRATION BEFORE ANYTHING IS READ OFF THIS ([[PK103]] step 7). Route B is re-derived
 * here and must reproduce the committed probe EXACTLY — 934 posed / 873 splice /
 * 61 rebuild — and Route A's identity base must reproduce `1058-refined-placement`'s
 * asserted 1013. Both are asserted below. If either moves, this instrument is wrong
 * and its treatment column means nothing.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FIRST RUN FAILED THAT SECOND ANCHOR — 1021 against 1013 — and the cause was a
 * POPULATION difference I had assumed away, not a behavioural one. The two reference
 * probes do not share a corpus list: `1058` dedupes (`[...new Set(...)]`, :73) while
 * `_1007-subdivide-locality` does not, and Route B's 934 is only reproducible on the
 * UNDEDUPED list. Recorded rather than swapped, because the failure is the evidence
 * that the anchor is live: the sweep therefore runs undeduped (so B calibrates) and
 * counts DISTINCT identity-base minis alongside (so A calibrates). Relaxing either
 * assertion would have been the cheap move and would have left the instrument unpinned
 * at exactly the end being read.
 *
 * GUARD, because this is where P4e lost a gesture ([[P606]]): `scaleStepGrid` takes
 * `'double' | 'halve'` and vitest does not typecheck. `posedB` counts only asks where
 * the model VERIFIABLY doubled, and every denominator is printed and asserted.
