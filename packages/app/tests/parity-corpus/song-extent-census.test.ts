/**
 * The `songExtent` census over the real saved corpus — the pin that says what
 * fraction of real documents a "whole arrangement" bounce can actually serve
 * (#1359).
 *
 * WHY A CENSUS AND NOT ONLY UNIT TESTS. The unit tests next door pin the walk's
 * SEMANTICS against synthetic IR. They cannot say whether those semantics reach
 * anything real, and the number that decides the feature's shape is exactly
 * that: measured here, 3 documents in 150 yield a trustworthy arrangement
 * extent (2 until #1476 — see `ARRANGED` for why the third arrived). A change that quietly widened `arranged` — dropping the opaque taint,
 * say — would keep every unit test green while handing documents a confident
 * length a bounce would truncate to. This arm is what notices.
 *
 * ⚠ THE CORPUS IS SAVED LIVE-CODING SKETCHES, NOT STAVE SONGS. It skews hard to
 * loops because arrangements of the kind the full-song work is about mostly do
 * not exist out there yet. So `loop: 141` is a fact about what people write
 * TODAY, not a ceiling on the feature — read it as "the loop case cannot be the
 * unsupported half", never as "arrangements do not matter".
 *
 * ## WHY THIS PIN NAMES DOCUMENTS AND NOT ONLY COUNTS (#1469)
 *
 * It used to pin three integers. It drifted by three documents, in TWO steps
 * from TWO different modules, and the counts could say neither which documents
 * nor which module — so the drift was attributed entirely to the nearer of the
 * two changes and the third mover went unnoticed until it was measured.
 *
 * Reproduced by loading the old `songExtent` and the old `parseStrudel` beside
 * the current ones, in one run, over the byte-identical corpus:
 *
 * | mover | verdict | what moved it |
 * |---|---|---|
 * | `250/19FzyPQc7bcR` | loop → opaque | `songExtent` learning the weighted `NamedPick` (#1427) |
 * | `500/3Xv8ssjN67qW` | loop → opaque | the same |
 * | `500/3Y6Nw-c4WlmA` | loop → opaque | a `parseStrudel` change — the walk is unchanged for it |
 *
 * The last one is the point. **A census over parsed documents is a pin on the
 * PARSER as much as on the walk**, and nothing said so. `#1481`'s `Range` arm,
 * by contrast, moved nothing at all here.
 *
 * ⚠ AND ITS DIRECTION IS THE PROOF IT IS A SHARPENING AND NOT A REGRESSION. The
 * document moved loop → opaque, which means an arrangement became FOUND where
 * none was found before — only a parser that reads MORE can do that. A parser
 * that had started reading LESS would wrap the arrangement in a `Code` it could
 * not see past, and the document would have moved the other way. So the exact
 * commit among the fourteen need not be bisected to know the verdict is right.
 *
 * So the sets are named. A future drift fails with the document in the message,
 * and the two-line question "which module, and is the new verdict right?" is
 * answerable from the failure instead of from archaeology.
 *
 * ## WHY EVERY `opaque` DOCUMENT IS CORRECTLY OPAQUE, MEASURED 2026-09-11
 *
 * `opaque` means "an arrangement is here but something unread sits above it".
 * The tempting reading is that the taint is over-eager. It is not: each of the
 * six is tainted by a method the parser genuinely cannot read, and several of
 * those provably move time.
 *
 * | document | the unread method(s) above its arrangement |
 * |---|---|
 * | `0/-KLGNJUtyyj1`   | `.pianoroll(…)`, **`.cpm(55)`** |
 * | `250/19FzyPQc7bcR` | `.when("<0!10 1!2>", x=>x.ply(2))` |
 * | `250/19iySfKDfQK5` | `.pianoroll()`, **`.echo(3, 28/64, …)`**, `.note()` |
 * | `500/3HWHF_ZUbZD_` | `.dough()` |
 * | `500/3Xv8ssjN67qW` | `.when("<0!10 1!2>", x=>x.ply(2))` |
 * | `500/3Y6Nw-c4WlmA` | `.add(room(.25))`, `.mask4(…)`, `.warble()`, `.voicing()`, `.chord()` |
 *
 * `.cpm` sets tempo and `.echo` adds delayed repeats — for those two the extent
 * really is untrustworthy, not merely unproven. ⚠ And note what does NOT help:
 * `.pianoroll()` is a visualiser and provably moves nothing, but both documents
 * carrying it also carry a real transform, so exempting visualisers would move
 * no document out of `opaque`. **The road from `opaque` to `arranged` runs
 * through the parser learning these methods, not through relaxing the taint** —
 * which is the bias `songExtent`'s header already commits to.
