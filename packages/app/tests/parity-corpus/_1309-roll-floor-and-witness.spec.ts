/**
 * _1309-roll-floor-and-witness.spec.ts — THROWAWAY INSTRUMENT. The roll's half of
 * `_1301-floor-and-witness.spec.ts`: of the bytes the shipped roll writer moves when
 * subdividing, how many did the ASK force and how many are slack?
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts _1309-roll-floor-and-witness
 *
 * WHY. `_1309-roll-subdivide-route` established that the roll reproduces the grid's
 * route answer — the shipped road moves p50 0.255 of a long document against the model
 * rescale's 0.978, where the grid reads 0.298 against 0.988. But a byte ratio is
 * measured against NOTHING, so it cannot tell "the notation forced this" from "the
 * writer was lazy". The grid settled that with a floor and a witness. This asks the
 * same of the roll, in the same shape, so the two answers are comparable rather than
 * merely both true.
 *
 * NEVER MEASURE A COST AGAINST NOTHING. Two bounds beside every cost, same unit, same ask:
 *
 *   FLOOR    the bytes of the SOURCE that denote the thing being edited. Two nested:
 *              ELEMENT  the top-level region containing the edited column
 *                       (`SourceRegion.raw` minus its padding)
 *              ATOM     the edited note's own span (`RollLeafAnchor.span`)
 *            ATOM is inside ELEMENT by construction, and C5 checks exactly that.
 *            ⚠ THE NOTE A SUBDIVIDE CREATES HAS NO BYTES, so it has no ATOM of its own.
 *            The note whose slot it SPLITS does — placing into the back half of `g3`
 *            need only re-spell `g3` as `[g3 x]` — and that is the tighter floor for
 *            the same ask. Both are reported; they answer different questions.
 *
 *   WITNESS  ANOTHER CORRECT ANSWER to the same ask, by a different writer. Where byte
 *            surgery answers, the unit is asked twice: once as shipped (surgery answers)
 *            and once with the overlay fields stripped, so the element writer answers.
 *            An ACHIEVED bound rather than a derived one, on one tree in one run — never
 *            a stash as a control arm.
 *
 * SLACK IS WHAT WAS AVOIDABLE, `COST - SLACK` IS FORCED. A writer that grows `g3` into
 * `[g3 x]` pays a large COST and zero SLACK: every byte was inside the span it had to
 * touch. That is optimal, not lazy, and a byte ratio cannot see the difference.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT A ZERO LICENSES is less than it looks: zero slack against a floor says the
 * write stayed inside THAT span, never that the spelling inside it is the shortest
 * correct one. A claim of "local", never of "minimal".
 *
 * ⚠ THE SLACK METRIC IS THE GRID PROBE'S SECOND DESIGN, DELIBERATELY. Its first —
 * measuring the part of the changed WINDOW lying outside the floor — reads 0 for every
 * pure INSERTION, because an insertion consumes no `before` bytes: `ab` -> `aXb` has a
 * zero-width window and nothing can lie outside anything. Placing a note IS an
 * insertion, so that design cannot fire on the case under test. `slackOutside` below is
 * the corrected one — head and tail survival — copied from the arm that survived its
 * own refutation, not from the one that was refuted.
 *
 * POPULATION, and what is excluded and why (measured first, never assumed):
 *   597 rolls open · 485 carry a `.source` tiling · of those 472 are SINGLE-PART.
 *   The 13 multi-part rolls are EXCLUDED and counted. A `RollNote` carries no part
 *   index — unlike a grid lane, which has `part` on it — so for a `,`-stacked roll
 *   there is no non-inventing way to say which part a note belongs to. Excluding 13
 *   and saying so is honest; guessing a part would put the floor on the wrong element
 *   and every slack figure downstream would be fiction.
 *
 * CONTROLS, because a clean reading from a detector never shown to fire is not evidence.
 * Each is printed with its rate beside the result:
 *   C1 TILING       the regions must reconstruct the source BYTE-FOR-BYTE. If they do
 *                   not, the offsets are fiction and nothing may be read.
 *   C2 FIRES        asked of ROUTE B, the model rescale that re-derives the whole line.
 *                   SLACK must be large there or the detector cannot fire at all.
 *   C3 SILENT       asked of the byte-surgery DELETE against the note's own ATOM span.
 *                   SLACK must be 0 there or the floor construction is wrong.
 *   C4 NON-VACUOUS  the floor must be a STRICT SUBSET of the document on a real
 *                   sub-population, else every slack is 0 for an uninteresting reason.
 *   C5 ON TARGET    the note's ATOM span must lie INSIDE the region containing its
 *                   column. Two independently-derived facts about the same bytes —
 *                   krill's locations on one side, the tiling walk on the other — so a
 *                   column-to-region mapping off by one is caught by something other
 *                   than itself.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ C3 FIRED ON ITS FIRST RUN AND THE DEFECT WAS IN THIS PROBE, NOT IN THE WRITER —
 * which is what a control is for, and it is recorded here rather than quietly fixed.
 * The delete gesture identified its target note by `(pitch, start)`. That is NOT a
 * unique key: a `,`-stack can hold the same pitch twice in one group, and the corpus
 * has such a unit — `[0,7,0]`, where pitch `0` appears at start 0 twice. The filter
 * removed BOTH, producing `[~,7,~]`, and the anchor lookup resolved to the first of two
 * different byte spans. So the arm was measuring a two-note delete against a one-note
 * floor, on 1 of 364. Byte surgery was behaving correctly throughout.
 * The fix is identity, not tolerance: the delete target is now the first note whose
 * `(pitch, start)` is unique, `atomOf` REFUSES an ambiguous anchor rather than picking
 * one, and both exclusions are counted and printed (they read 0 — every roll had a
 * uniquely-identifiable note, so nothing was lost). Relaxing C3 to `<= 1` would have
 * been the cheap move and would have unpinned the instrument at exactly the end being
 * read.
 *
 * OBSERVED on this tree, 1633 minis -> 597 rolls -> 485 with a tiling -> 472 single-part.
 * Long docs are >= 40 chars, because the ratio is confounded below that.
 *
 *   arm                                        n    cost   slack   slack==0
 *   ROUTE A subdivide+place vs its ELEMENT    470   0.255   0.000   470/470
 *   ROUTE A subdivide+place vs its ATOM       375   0.254   0.122   271/375
 *   ROUTE B model rescale   vs its ELEMENT    470   0.973   0.494   179/470   <- C2
 *   delete by byte surgery  vs its ATOM       364   0.024   0.000   364/364   <- C3
 *   delete by the element writer vs its ATOM  364   0.072   0.033   284/364
 *
 * THE ANSWER, and it is the grid's: the shipped roll subdivide left the element it had
 * to touch on ZERO of 470 asks, where the same detector catches route B leaving it on
 * 291. ⚠ READ THAT ZERO AT ITS REAL STRENGTH — on 139 of the 470 the floor IS the whole
 * document, where a zero is trivially true; the load-bearing part is the other 331,
 * counted on the SUBDIVIDE leg rather than borrowed from the delete leg. The residue
 * over the delete anchor is the ask, not the writer.
 * What IS avoidable sits one level down and is a SPELLING question, exactly as on the
 * grid: on 104 of 375 the write spreads beyond the atom it subdivides. That is 27.7%
 * against the grid's 84 of 585 (14.4%) — the one place the two surfaces differ in
 * degree rather than agreeing.
 *
 * ⚠⚠ THIS FILE ASSUMES THE WRITE IS CORRECT AND CANNOT CHECK IT. A writer that
 * SWALLOWED the placement would move few bytes and score zero slack, and this
 * instrument would call that optimal. `wrote nothing` is printed per arm for exactly
 * that reason. Correctness for this route and gesture is established elsewhere.
