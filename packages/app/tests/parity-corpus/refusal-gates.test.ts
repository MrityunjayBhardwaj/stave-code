/**
 * refusal-gates.test.ts — every refusal names the gate that actually stopped it
 * (#990), measured over the real-world corpus.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Three writers stack behind one parse call:
 *
 *   parse{StepGrid,PianoRoll}Core → element projection → leaf projection
 *
 * and the `reason` a refused unit reported used to be whichever of them declined
 * FIRST — almost always the syntactic core. Nothing downstream updated it, so the
 * reason described a subsystem that often had nothing to do with why the unit was
 * unavailable. That was not a tidiness problem: the class our blocker backlog
 * ranked near the top for months, "nested groups are beyond the editable subset",
 * turns out to contain ZERO units stopped by anything to do with nesting. We were
 * steering by a signal that pointed at the wrong module.
 *
 * WHAT IS MEASURED, through the REAL shipped parsers — never a re-walk of the
 * gate sequence, which would be a second oracle that can only agree with itself:
 * for each of the 1500 corpus units, both surfaces are asked, and every refusal
 * is bucketed by the `gate` the parser itself reports.
 *
 * THE ASSERTIONS are about LEGIBILITY, not reach. This phase must move no
 * verdict — `writer-reach.test.ts` holds the floors, `mini-corpus.test.ts` pins
 * every verdict — so what is gated here is that the refusals are CAUSAL:
 *   1. every refusal a projection produced carries a gate;
 *   2. the syntactic core's feature vocabulary ("nested groups", "beyond the
 *      editable subset", "is not a note name") never surfaces on a unit a
 *      projection ruled on;
 *   3. the gates are non-vacuous — the dominant ones actually occur;
 *   4. wrong-surface is separable from the rest, because it is the bucket that
 *      must be read differently depending on who is asking (see below).
 *
 * READING `wrong-surface`. It is ~67% of all refusals HERE and it is mostly not a
 * failure: this sweep asks BOTH surfaces of every unit, so a drum pattern
 * declining the piano roll is counted, and it should be — the pattern is simply
 * not the roll's. That single fact inflated every denominator quoted off a
 * both-surfaces sweep. It reads the OTHER way in `editCoverage.ts`, which routes
 * by head exactly as the app does: there a `wrong-surface` unit is one whose head
 * asks for a view its own values cannot fill, and the user gets code. Same gate,
 * two honest readings — which is the whole reason to name it rather than fold it
 * into "refused".
