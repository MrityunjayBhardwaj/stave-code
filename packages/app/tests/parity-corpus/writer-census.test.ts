/**
 * writer-census.test.ts — WHICH WRITER SERVES EACH SURFACE-ASK, and what would
 * serve it if the syntactic core were deleted (#1009, epic #1007 phase P3).
 *
 * ── THE QUESTION ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `notation/parse.ts`'s syntactic core (M2 — krill AST → cells) is the largest
 * block of meaning re-derivation left in the editing path. It cannot simply be
 * deleted: it serves surface-asks that NEITHER derived projection serves, and
 * deleting it today deletes those views. So the question is not "can we remove
 * it" but "how much of its reach TRANSFERS to the derived projections" — and the
 * answer has to be per ask, because an aggregate that stays flat hides a large
 * re-routing in both directions ([[PK58]]).
 *
 * ── THE MEASUREMENT IS A COUNTERFACTUAL, RUN AS EQUAL-AND-OPPOSITE MOVES ──────
 * For every ask the core serves, BOTH writers are put through the SAME edit probe
 * (`engineEditOracle.ts`, the one `writer-reach.test.ts` uses):
 *
 *   incumbent    — the core's own model. VERIFIED, never assumed: an ask whose
 *                  core edit corrupts was never reach on either side, and
 *                  charging it to the projection would be a free win for the
 *                  incumbent.
 *   counterfactual — `project{StepGrid,PianoRoll}Derived`, the real writer chain
 *                  below the core, asked in the real order. Never re-derived
 *                  here: the order is the contract and a local copy of it is a
 *                  second oracle ([[PV192]]).
 *
 * ── WHAT IS COUNTED, AND WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ─────────────────────────────
 * Four outcomes per ask, and the third is not a failure:
 *   transfers        — a derived writer opens it AND the edit survives the engine
 *   no-view          — no derived writer opens it at all (untransferable, parse)
 *   view-corrupts    — a derived writer opens it and the edit corrupts
 *                      (untransferable, edit — and the worse of the two, because
 *                      the view looks fine)
 *   no-probe         — opened, but no clean single-note delete exists. UNVERIFIED,
 *                      neither transferred nor untransferable ([[PK59]] step 5).
 *
 * ── WHY THE ASK COUNT IS NOT A MINI COUNT ─────────────────────────────────────
 * A mini can be core-served on BOTH surfaces, so 2 asks can be 1 string. Both
 * figures are printed and the distinct-mini count is the one to quote when the
 * question is "how much TEXT loses its view" ([[PV231]] clause 3).
 *
 * ── THE ASSERTIONS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The denominator is pinned to `writer-reach`'s complement (803 grid / 414 roll,
 * both derived from the same corpus by the same core functions), so this census
 * and that gate cannot drift apart silently. The transfer figures are pinned as
 * a BAND, not a floor: this is a measurement, and a number that moves in either
 * direction is a finding either way.

    // `no-probe` unmoved at 100:
    //   - 9 `view-corrupts → transfers`, the writes that now keep the length they always
    //     kept the onsets for (`<c2*2 g2*5 [a g]>`, `sd*2 sd*4 sd*8`, …);
    //   - 2 `view-corrupts → no-view`, gate `view-unusable` — `[bd ~]*2` and `[- - sd -]*2`,
    //     where the resolution cannot spell the length at all, so the writer declines and
    //     the view is no longer offered. That is the ranking this project already held:
    //     a view that never opens beats one that opens and mis-writes.
    // So transfers gains 9 while untransferable loses 9 (its no-view half rises 67 → 69,
    // its corrupting half falls 11 → 0). The rate was 1035/1204 = 86.0%, over the SAME
