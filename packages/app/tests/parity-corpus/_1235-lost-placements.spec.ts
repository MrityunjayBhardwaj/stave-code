/**
 * _1235-lost-placements.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT. WHICH leaf placements the length refusal
 * took, and — the question that decides whether the refusal is right — whether the write
 * they USED to produce actually matched the model the user was shown.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1235-lost-placements.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * `placement-admissibility` moved 3834 → 3860 refused and 20 → 18 placing leaf grids.
 *
 * ⚠ THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS PROBE ANSWERED "0 caused by the length check" AND WAS
 * VACUOUS TWICE OVER. It hand-rolled the placement without `clampLane`, so it never
 * built the model the panel builds; and its control forced each cell's length onto its
 * anchor's, which is where the lengths already came from — an intervention that changed
 * nothing, reading exactly like one that did ([[P525]]). It uses the real ungated op now,
 * and the control is the WRITTEN DOCUMENT re-parsed: if the bytes the old writer produced
 * do not project back to the model the user was looking at, the refusal is a fix and not
 * a reach loss.
