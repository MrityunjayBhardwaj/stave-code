/**
 * _1161-vanishing-rows.spec.ts — PROBE (inert: `_` prefix + `.spec.ts`).
 *
 * WHEN A DELETE TAKES AWAY THE ROW YOU WOULD CLICK BACK ON — measured on BOTH surfaces,
 * because the answer turns out to be different on each, and the difference is the design.
 *
 * #1161 measured the grid: clearing a lane's last sounding cell removes the LANE, because
 * a lane is drawn for a sound the document mentions and the document no longer mentions
 * it. 1345 asks, larger than every refusal class combined. Its scope line says the roll
 * was not measured — the same gap that doubled #1160's population.
 *
 * ⚠ BUT THE ROLL IS NOT SIMPLY THE SAME QUESTION, because the roll ALREADY CARRIES THE
 * MECHANISM #1161 IS ASKING FOR. `PianoRollGrid.tsx` keeps a STICKY pitch range: it
 * expands to fit the notes, never shrinks within a statement binding, and reseeds when
 * the statement changes (#391, #597). So a deleted note's row stays on screen even after
 * the content range around it has collapsed. The grid has no equivalent — grep says
 * 4 mentions of sticky in the roll panel, 0 in the sequencer panel.
 *
 * That makes this probe's job to measure THREE things, not one:
 *   1. the grid's population, re-derived on the current tree (the issue's figure predates
 *      #1154 and #1160, and a rate measured on a tree whose writer has changed is not
 *      this tree's rate);
 *   2. what the roll's sticky range SAVES — how many deletes would drop the note's row out
 *      of the display if the range were recomputed from content each time. This is the
 *      positive control that the mechanism is load-bearing rather than decorative;
 *   3. that with the sticky rule applied the roll's number is zero, which is the shape the
 *      grid should be made to match.
 *
 * ✅ THE RE-IMPLEMENTATION IS GONE (#1163 fixed). This probe used to carry a third copy of
 * the panel's private padding rule, because the function and its constants were
 * module-private to `PianoRollGrid.tsx` and nothing outside the panel could ask the real
 * one. `rollContentRange` in `notation/model.ts` now owns it, so this asks the real rule
 * and the figures below are about the panel rather than about a copy of it. The one
 * remaining restatement is in `placement-admissibility.test.ts`, kept deliberately as a
 * control arm and labelled there.
