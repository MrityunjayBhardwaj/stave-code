 *
 * The free-zone gate reports asks that are arithmetically free but REFUSED by the
 * parser, attributed to a NAMED path rather than assumed to be any one issue's.
 *
 * ⚠ ATTRIBUTION IS BY THE GATE THE ENTRY RETURNED, never by a pattern-match over the
 * mini (#1130). The first version bucketed on `/(^|\s)_(\s|$)/` for "held note" and
 * `mini.includes('<')` for "alternation". Measured against the pre-#1120 population,
 * the sustain detector fired on **0 of 16** asks it was named for — all sixteen fell
 * through to `other`. The class had no representative at all: **all six units spell
 * their length as `@n` and not one contains a `_` character**, so the bucket was
 * unreachable rather than merely under-counted. (#1130's body says five of six; the
 * measured answer is six of six.) The totals were still right, because the total is
 * counted independently of the buckets — an instrument that reports the right total
 * through a detector that never fires reads as consistent to anyone checking it
 * against its own output.
 *
 * `ParseResult.gate` is the machine-readable decline site (`model.ts` `Gate`, #990).
 * It is produced by the projection that actually declined, so it cannot drift from
 * the code the way a regex over source text does, and the same call answers for both
 * surfaces without a second vocabulary.
 *
 * ⚠ THE GRANULARITY IS THE PROJECTION, NOT THE WRITER GUARD. All 16 pre-#1120 asks
 * report `edit-unsafe`, which is one named site with no residual — but `edit-unsafe`
 * is raised at nine places in `parse.ts`, so two distinct writer guards would arrive
 * here indistinguishable. That they did NOT here was MEASURED, with a throwaway
 * tagging patch inside `serialize.ts` reporting the distinct guard set each ask
 * touched: all 16 touch exactly one — `sustainTokens`' refusal to lead a `[…]` group
 * with a `_` — and no other. That finer answer is what #1130 means by "the writer
 * says why", and it is what makes one gate sufficient here. It is deliberately
 * NOT shipped: the writer declines at ~80 `return null` sites, and threading a second
 * reason vocabulary through them would duplicate, at the same boundary, what `Gate`
 * already owns. Reach for it when a population actually splits inside one gate.
 *
 * ⚠ THE POPULATION IS EMPTY ON THIS TREE — grid 0 / roll 0 free-zone refusals, since
 * #1117 cleared the roll and the alternation grid and #1120 cleared the held-note
 * grid. An empty run is this probe reporting health, NOT the probe being broken; a
 * change that reopens refusals is what it exists to catch. To exercise it, revert the
 * writer under test (e.g. `serialize.ts` to a pre-#1120 commit) and re-run.

/**
 * The bucket an ask falls in.
 *
 * ⚠ A MISSING `gate` IS NOT LABELLED AS A CAUSE, and that restraint is the whole
 * lesson of #1130 applied to this file's own replacement. The tempting label is "the
 * syntactic core answered before any projection ran" — the one documented case
 * (`not-a-pattern`, which `refused` passes through verbatim). It would be wrong:
 * swept over the corpus at scales 1/2/3/4/8/16, **788 refusals carry no gate** (456
 * grid / 332 roll), and they are the view-resolution family, where a projection did
 * speak and simply did not record it (#1132). 27 of them carry the `view-resolution`
 * gate's character-identical sentence while 102 of the same class do carry the field.
 *
 * So the reason string is carried through VERBATIM instead. An unattributed ask then
 * describes itself and stays visibly unattributed, rather than being given a cause
 * this probe cannot actually know ([[P417]]: a missing self-report must not read as a
 * verdict — which is exactly how `other` swallowed all 16 asks before).
