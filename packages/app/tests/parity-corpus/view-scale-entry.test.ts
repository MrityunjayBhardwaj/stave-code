/**
 * view-scale-entry.test.ts — the view resolution asked through the PUBLIC ENTRIES (#1116).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS GATE EXISTS, AND WHY THE EXISTING ONES COULD NOT CATCH IT ────────
 * #1055 shipped `ViewScale` into `projectStepGridDerived` / `projectPianoRollDerived`
 * and proved it live by calling those projections directly. That is a correct test of
 * the projections — and it never exercises `parseStepGrid` / `parsePianoRoll`, which
 * try the syntactic CORE first and return it whenever it succeeds. 783 of the 958
 * corpus units that open a grid are core-parsed, and 412 of the 544 that open a roll,
 * including `bd ~ sn ~`, the case the resolution work is named after. So a seam proved
 * live through its own module was unreachable through the entry every caller uses.
 *
 * The lesson generalises past this fix: a gate must enter where callers enter. This
 * file therefore only ever calls `parseStepGrid(mini, k)` / `parsePianoRoll(mini, k)`.
 *
 * ── THE FOUR PROPERTIES ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   INERT       an explicit `UNREFINED` is indistinguishable from omitting the argument.
 *   LIVE        a scale reaches real units and multiplies the drawn columns by exactly k.
 *   FAITHFUL    a refine is pure MAGNIFICATION — same lanes/notes, every onset at
 *               exactly k× its old column and nothing else moved.
 *   SAME WRITER a refine comes back owned by the same writer, tiling the same source
 *               bytes — because that is WHO will rewrite the user's document.
 *
 * LIVE alone is satisfied by a projection that draws k× the columns and puts the notes
 * anywhere. FAITHFUL says the view still shows the same music. SAME WRITER is the one
 * added after the fact, and it is the one that caught the deepest defect — see below.
 *
 * ── THE TWO DEFECTS THIS FILE'S OWN FIRST VERSION SHIPPED WITH ────────────────
 * Both were in the SAME direction — a correct model discarded, or the right model
 * produced by the wrong path — and neither is visible in a diff:
 *
 *  1. THE SELF-REPORT IS AN OBLIGATION. The entry decides "was this actually refined?"
 *     by reading `model.viewScale`. Only the CORE paths had been taught to set it, so
 *     the element projection — which multiplies `perBar` by the scale and draws
 *     correctly — was refused for saying nothing. 96 of the first version's 198
 *     "honest refusals" were faithful k× models thrown away. Whoever multiplies by the
 *     scale must also record it.
 *
 *  2. ROUTING MUST NOT DEPEND ON THE VIEW. Ownership was decided by asking each layer
 *     AT THE SCALE, which conflates "I do not own this pattern" with "I own it but
 *     cannot draw it finer yet" — both arrive as `ok: false`. So a scale refusal fell
 *     through to the next writer: 20 grid and 17 roll units changed writer on a zoom,
 *     and 36 of the 37 were faithful magnifications that would have shipped in
 *     silence. Ownership is now asked at `UNREFINED`, at both levels of the chain.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS GATE CAN AND CANNOT SEE, MEASURED RATHER THAN CLAIMED ───────────
 * Re-breaking the routing fix reddens the grid arm with 8 named entries. That is NOT
 * all 20 swaps, and the gap is the honest part: measured under the break, only 6 of
 * the 20 (at ×2) produce a model that DIFFERS at all — the other 14 come back with the
 * same bytes, the same strides and the same content, because the two writers tile
 * those patterns identically. No assertion over the returned model can name them, and
 * saying so is better than quoting 20 as though this file demonstrated it. The fix is
 * justified by the 6 it repairs plus the fact that two separate implementations are
 * free to diverge on the next change; the gate holds the line where the line is
 * visible.
 *
 * ── THE REFUSALS ARE ASSERTED, NOT TOLERATED ──────────────────────────────────
 * Several projections legitimately do not carry a scale: the leaf path anchors each
 * note to its own source span and has no span to subdivide (#1058, and [[PV261]] —
 * it offers no resolution op at all today, so nothing goes dark), while the
 * whole-cycle `<…>` bar expansion and `gridFromAltElements`/`rollFromAltElements`
 * have not been taught it. Those units REFUSE rather than answer a refine request
 * with the document's own layout. The counts are pinned here so that a path silently
 * starting to lie shows up as a number rather than as a passing suite.
