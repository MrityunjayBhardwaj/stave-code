/**
 * _1257-chord-rule.spec.ts — DECISION INSTRUMENT for the chord/octave collision.
 *
 * #1256 found that the chord grammar reads a trailing octave digit as a chord
 * QUALITY, so 125 of 210 note spellings parse as chord symbols and a trumpet
 * melody gets captioned "Chord chart". This measured the candidate rule against
 * the real vocabularies and the real corpora BEFORE any production code moved,
 * because the constraint that decides it cannot be reasoned to: whatever landed
 * had to keep the three genuine charts captioned, and `<Gsus G7 Em7 D7>` contains
 * `G7` and `D7`, which are themselves ordinary note spellings. It shipped, so
 * this now measures the rule as it stands and is kept as the record of both.
 *
 * ── THE RULE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Not "note names are not chords" — `C` really is a legal chord symbol, and a
 * rule that denies it is a lie about the grammar. The precedence goes one level
 * up, where the question actually is:
 *
 *   a grid is a chord chart when every lane is a chord symbol AND at least one
 *   lane is a chord symbol that is NOT also an ordinary note spelling.
 *
 * That is the `cb` precedence rule generalised rather than a second rule beside
 * it. `chordLanes.ts` already argues that "a grid's lanes are sounds by default
 * and a chord reading has to DISPLACE that rather than tie with it" — it just
 * applied the argument to one cowbell. A lane set of `a4 a4 a4 a4` ties: every
 * token is equally readable as a pitch, so nothing displaces the default. A
 * lane set containing `Gsus` does not tie, because no other reading explains it.
 *
 * The pitch question is asked of `pitchToMidi`, which is the ROLL's own
 * note-name authority (`parse.ts:3070` decides what the roll accepts with it),
 * so the two surfaces cannot come to different views about what a pitch is.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1257-chord-rule.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts

/**
 * ⚠ THIS FILE NO LONGER HOLDS A COPY OF THE RULE, and the sequence matters.
 *
 * The candidate was spelled here first, deliberately, so that it could be
 * measured against both corpora before a line of production changed. It shipped,
 * so the copy is gone and both names below are imported from the module that
 * decides — `chordLanes` now carries the evidence clause itself, which is why
 * `candidateChordLanes` no longer exists as a separate thing to compare against.
 *
 * What that costs is the before/after column: this file measures the rule AS
 * SHIPPED, and the "125 of 210 read as a chart / 15 captioned, 3 kept" figures
 * are recorded in `chordLanes.ts` and in the issue rather than recomputed here
 * against a second implementation. A local copy kept for the comparison would be
 * a second oracle for exactly the reason #1259 existed.
