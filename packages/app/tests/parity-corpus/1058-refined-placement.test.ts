/**
 * 1058-refined-placement.test.ts — placing a hit on a refined grid subdivides the
 * element under it and leaves the rest of the document alone (#1058, Phase 5 of
 * #1052).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A GATE AND NOT A SPIKE ────────────────────────────────────────
 * The spike (`_1058-locality.spec.ts`, cont.159) answered the GO/no-GO question
 * against machinery that did not exist yet: it carried its own `refine()`, a
 * hand-written model rescale, because the reader had no view-scale parameter.
 * #1055 / #1116 / #1117 shipped one, #1057 shipped the write path, and the
 * region splice already spelled a multi-column step as a group — so the phase's
 * behaviour arrived as the composition of its predecessors. What was missing was
 * a gate.
 *
 * ── EVERYTHING HERE IS ASKED, NOT DESCRIBED ───────────────────────────────────
 * Reader `parseStepGrid(mini, k)` · placement `toggleCell` / `placeNote` (the one
 * definition, #1048) · the ÷k guard `collapse*ToDocument` · writer
 * `serializeStepGridWithExtent` · engine `enginePlayedCycle`. Acceptance is
 * `op(m) !== m`, the signal the `notation/` op family defines (#1073) — never a
 * non-null serialize, which reads every refusal as an acceptance.
 *
 * ⚠ LOCALITY IS THE WRITER'S OWN REPORT. The obvious instrument — walk
 * `prefix`/`before`/`raw`/`after`/`suffix` back into absolute offsets and read a
 * byte diff against them — is a SECOND DESCRIPTION of the order `spliceGrid`
 * concatenates in, and it is wrong in a way its own output cannot reveal. When a
 * voided `,`-part holds a single element, rebuilding the part and re-emitting
 * that element produce a diff of the same shape. Measured over 15,200 asks, both
 * instruments side by side: they agree 14,992 times, disagree 208, and every one
 * of the 208 is the walk calling a whole-part rebuild local. Zero errors the
 * other way — the entire error runs toward the verdict nobody re-checks. So the
 * walk is not merely redundant here, it is unsound, and `GridWriteExtent` exists
 * because the writer already decided both facts and threw them away (#1137).
 *
 * ⚠ THOSE TWO-INSTRUMENT FIGURES ARE HISTORICAL — taken when the part-void was
 * unconditional, and kept because they are the ARGUMENT for reporting locality from
 * the writer rather than a description of today's residual. #1137 has since removed
 * most of the population they measured (278 non-local asks → 34). Re-taking them
 * would not re-make the point: the walk's blindness is structural, not a rate.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT THIS GATE DOES NOT ASSERT, stated rather than left to be assumed:
 * lane-add (works on a fixture, no corpus arm); resize and paste at a refined
 * view; the alternation path's locality — an alt model carries no `source`, so the
 * writer has no regions to report and the question is not defined there; and the
 * ROLL's locality, which is asserted only as accept-and-spell here. The roll has no
 * write-extent report yet, so its arm below is deliberately the weaker one and says
 * so rather than implying the grid's guarantee covers it.

/**
 * The units whose write STILL rebuilds a whole `,`-part instead of splicing it,
 * after #1137 (was 21 units / 278 asks; now 4 / 34).
 *
 * PINNED BY NAME rather than counted, so a change there reads as a named delta and a
 * regression cannot hide inside a rate. The same set appears at the document's own
 * resolution with no refinement in play — so refining does not open this, it only
 * supplies more columns at which it fires.
 *
 * ⚠ WHAT LEAVING THIS LIST MEANS, since the direction is not symmetric. A unit
 * DROPPING off is a part that now splices — the #1137 fix reaching further. A unit
 * ARRIVING is a part that stopped splicing, which is a regression: the writer had a
 * local answer for it and lost one.
 *
 * ⚠ THE REASON THE THREE BELOW ARE STILL HERE IS NOT THE REASON THE FOUR WERE (#1151).
 * The list used to be four, and its stated cause — "reading the part finer produced no
 * spelling at all" — turned out to be the fallback's trigger rather than a measured
 * diagnosis. `bd sd oh hh hh [oh hh oh], hh ht bd` left when the writer stopped
 * committing to the first width that admitted the hit's position: its 18 asks were
 * refused over a note a third of a column long, and a finer read spells that fine. It
 * now writes `[hh _ _ hh ~ …] ht bd`, with `ht` and `bd` untouched where the rebuild
 * used to flatten them.
 *
 * The three that remain each hold ONE region in the rebuilt part, and there the rebuild
 * is already the local answer — re-emitting the single element produces the same columns
 * and only adds brackets. So they are not a gap waiting on a fix; they are the shape for
 * which this class of fix has nothing to offer, which is why the writer stops rather than
 * reading them finer. The arm above pins that nothing BUT that shape is left.

 * #1151 stopped committing to the first width that admitted the hit. What neither
 * touches is a part that IS one element, because there the rebuild is already local —
 * so the class that remains is the one where the question is definitional rather than

 * 15,200, which is the right trade for a standing property but the wrong instrument
 * for a change: the asks #1137 moved are ~1.6% of the population, so a stride sample
 * contains a handful of them by luck. "The engine agrees" would then be a claim about
 * the code that did not change.
 *
 * A re-emit that alters an element's WEIGHT is silent data loss that re-parses
 * perfectly, so re-spelling `cr hh bd` as `[cr cr] hh bd` has to be answered by the
 * engine, not by reading the notation. These units are asked EXHAUSTIVELY below.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THIS ARM STILL CANNOT COVER THE WHOLE CHANGE — measured, not assumed. This
 * sweep steps `col += k` from 1, so at k=2 it only ever toggles ODD fine columns,
 * which never collapse to the document. It therefore never asks a DOCUMENT-resolution
 * placement at all. Breaking the writer's group subdivision (`p.div * growth` back to
 * `p.div`) changes the bytes of all 244 asks here and this file stays GREEN, because
 * every one of those re-spellings is hap-EQUIVALENT (`[E2 E2] ~` places E2 exactly
 * where `[E2 E2 ~ ~]` does, and an `@2` restores the weight the group gave up). The
 * same break at the document's own resolution produces `cr cr hh bd` — four elements
 * in a three-element part, so `hh` moves from a third of the cycle to a quarter — and
 * is caught by the editor's `writeExtent`/`place` arms, which do ask there.
 *
 * So the two layers cover disjoint placements and neither is redundant. Recorded
 * because a green here reads like whole-change coverage and is not.
