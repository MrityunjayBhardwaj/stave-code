/**
 * songPeriodSweep — THE ONE definition of "what period does the Song timeline
 * give this document", measured over the 150 real tunes (#1102).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS EXISTS BEFORE ANY FIX ───────────────────────────────────────────
 * `cycleFingerprints` decides the display span, the mark window, the sections,
 * the playhead wrap and every clip extent. A stricter fingerprint can only
 * LENGTHEN detected periods or null them ([[PV255]]), and `reachedCap` drives
 * only a LABEL (`FullSongTimeline.tsx:1409-1417`) while the span itself takes
 * `periodCycles ?? horizonCycles`, cap 256 — so a document reading period 1
 * today can land on a 256-cycle-wide timeline after a fix that is locally
 * correct. That risk is not analysable from the diff; it has to be swept.
 *
 * So this module is the BASELINE instrument, committed and pinned before the
 * production code is touched, and re-run afterwards with every moved document
 * enumerated per axis.
 *
 * ── FIDELITY: WHY IT GOES THROUGH THE PER-TRACK PATTERNS ─────────────────────
 * The whole defect lives in a lane key. `laneKeyOf` is `ev.trackId ?? ev.s`, and
 * production ALWAYS supplies a `trackId` — `getTimelineEvents` stamps the
 * capture key on every hap (`StrudelEngine.ts:1366-1378`) and `MusicalTimeline`
 * then remaps it to the structural lane (`MusicalTimeline.tsx:266`). A probe
 * that queried one stacked pattern would produce haps with no `trackId`, the
 * `?? ev.s` fallback would put the sample name into the fingerprint by accident,
 * and the sweep would report a healthy corpus. Hence `evalSongTracks`, which
 * mirrors `songPatterns` rather than the repl's play pattern.
 *
 * The analysis itself is the PRODUCTION function — `analyzeSong` with an
 * injected collector, exactly as `MusicalTimeline.tsx:269` calls it, so the
 * progressive horizon, the doubling, the cap and the one-loop trim are the real
 * ones and not a re-implementation ([[PV192]]: a second oracle can only agree
 * with itself).
 *
 * ── DECLARED BOUNDS, so no figure here is quoted wider than it holds ──────────
 *  1. 142 of the 150 tunes evaluate headlessly, and the eight that do not are
 *     NAMED (`evalHarness.ts` header: 5 document-intrinsic, 2 browser-bound,
 *     1 engine-version). Report the bound with every figure; do not smooth it.
 *  2. Lanes are keyed by CAPTURE key, not by the structural lane the app remaps
 *     to. Period is invariant under relabelling; only a join that MERGED two
 *     capture keys could move one (upward). See `evalSongTracks`' own note.
 *  3. `analyzeSong` stops at the first period it can confirm, so a document
 *     reported aperiodic is aperiodic WITHIN the 256-cycle cap — a different
 *     fact from "has no period", and counted separately.

/**
 * CANDIDATE FAMILY for #1104: a lane with no period of its own ABSTAINS from
 * the span instead of vetoing it.
 *
 * ── WHERE THE HYPOTHESIS COMES FROM ──────────────────────────────────────────
 * `detectDisplayPeriod` holds two rules that do not agree with each other. The
 * grounded one (#488, from real DAW manuals) is that lanes of differing lengths
 * PHASE: show the MAX, never the lcm, because "a 5-cycle track beside a 4-cycle
 * track shows a 5-cycle view (the 4-cycle loop repeats/phases inside it)". The
 * other is `if (p === null) return null` — one lane without a period discards
 * every OTHER lane's measured period and sends the whole document to the cap.
 *
 * If a 4-cycle lane can phase inside a 5-cycle view, a lane with no period can
 * phase inside a view sized by the lanes that have one. That is the first
 * direction #1104 lists ("show the structural loop, treat modulation as a
 * continuous field over it") — but arrived at as the existing rule extended one
 * case further rather than as a new philosophy, which makes it a MEASURABLE
 * hypothesis instead of a preference.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE FIRST MEASUREMENT REFUTED, and what it taught ───────────────────
 * Unconditional abstention (`atCapOnly: false`) was priced first and FAILED its
 * own disqualifier: 32 documents left the 256-cycle cap but 14 landed on period
 * 1 — the single stretched clip #1102 was filed for — and 5 of those had a
 * CORRECT bounded period before (12→1, 10→1, 8→1, 7→1, 6→1). Nine documents
 * appear in both the win and the cost list (cap → 1), so the honest recovery
 * was 23, not 32.
 *
 * The mechanism is NOT variant E's. Variant E failed because its probe window
 * could not see far enough. This failed at the combine step, and specifically at
 * the HORIZON: below the cap a `null` is what DOUBLES the horizon, so the veto
 * is not a defect there — it is the thing that gives a slow lane room to
 * resolve. Abstaining below the cap answers early with whatever short lane
 * happens to have resolved (a 1-cycle hi-hat), and the document never grows to
 * the horizon where its 12-cycle pad would have been found.
 *
 * ── THE FLOOR IS ON *WHEN* ABSTENTION MAY SPEAK ──────────────────────────────
 * So the refinement is not a bound on the period's size, it is a bound on the
 * horizon: keep the veto while the horizon can still grow, and abstain only
 * once growth is exhausted (`atCapOnly: true`). That is PV255's "a derived
 * exclusion rule must share the horizon of the detection it feeds", applied to
 * the combine step. Its production home is exactly `songAnalysis.ts:390`, the
 * `if (horizon >= cap)` branch that currently falls straight back to the cap —
 * where `horizon >= cap` is already in scope, so nothing needs re-deriving.
 *
 * Two further clauses are priced SEPARATELY so each is attributable rather than
 * bundled: `minPeriod` (refuse a period of 1 at the cap — a direct guard on the
 * #1102 shape) and `minLaneShare` (the abstaining lanes must be a minority, so
 * a span is never claimed on the strength of one lane out of seven).
 *
 * ── WHAT IS AND IS NOT VARIED ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Detection is production: this calls `cycleFingerprints` and `detectPeriod`
 * per lane exactly as `detectDisplayPeriod` does, and keys lanes with the
 * production `laneKeyOf`. ONLY the combine step differs. So a moved document is
 * attributable to that one rule and no second detector exists to agree with
 * itself ([[PV192]]).
 *
 * Injected into the real `analyzeSong` loop rather than applied to a finished
 * analysis, because — as the refutation above shows — the rule CHANGES WHICH
 * HORIZON the document resolves at, and that is most of the effect. Post-
 * processing a fixed-horizon snapshot would measure a different rule than the
 * one that would ship.
