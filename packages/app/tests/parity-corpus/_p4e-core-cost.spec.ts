/**
 * _p4e-core-cost.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT. What attaching P4d's overlay to the CORE path
 * would cost per parse, measured as a paired A/B on one tree in one session.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_p4e-core-cost.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * ⚠ THE INTERVENTION PRINTS ITS OWN EFFECT, and that line is read BEFORE the timing
 * ([[P546]]: a control arm that silently did not intervene reads exactly like one that
 * did, and reported +0.6% for a change that costs +59%). `overlays attached` is 0 on
 * the control tree and non-zero on the treatment tree; two arms with the same count
 * measured the same code and the timing below means nothing.
 *
 * The population is the CORE-OPENED units — the ones `parseStepGridCore` answers, which
 * is the hot path (783 of 958 corpus units, re-parsed on every edit), and the half P4d
 * did not touch.
