/**
 * edit-parity.test.ts — the EDIT-ability regression gate over the vendored corpus.
 *
 * Sibling of `parity.test.ts`. Where that one gates the TIMELINE parser
 * (`ir/parseStrudel` — "does this tune parse to a structured IR"), this one
 * gates the EDIT path (`visualEdit/notation/parse.ts` + `chunkDetect` — "can a
 * Stave grid/roll open this tune, and if not, WHY"). Until #903 nothing did:
 * the only instrument that measured editability was `edit-coverage.spec.ts`,
 * and a `.spec.ts` is maintainer-only and never runs in CI.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (the concrete failure it was born from). Swapping the
 * hand-rolled mini grammar for Strudel's own krill parser (#903 A1) recovered
 * 33 units and silently took ONE away — `[c4,e4,g4,c5]*2`, a chord with a
 * multiplier, stopped opening. The swept aggregate reported "+32", which reads
 * as a clean win; the regression only surfaced when the per-tune numbers were
 * diffed. That diff was a throwaway script. This file is that script, made
 * permanent, because:
 *   - the 201 notation unit tests did NOT catch it (they cover the subset by
 *     hand; they cannot know what real tunes contain), and
 *   - an aggregate percentage NETS a regression against a recovery, so the one
 *     number everybody quotes is exactly the number that hides this.
 *
 * WHAT IT ASSERTS. Per fixture: how many units are editable, and the exact
 * reason for every one that is not. That catches BOTH directions —
 *   - a unit that stops being editable (a regression), and
 *   - a unit that starts being editable without anyone deciding to widen the
 *     view (a gate leak).
 * Both show up as a snapshot diff.
 *
 * DRIFT POLICY (same as parity.test.ts — the diff IS the news):
 *   - A PR touching the edit path that moves this snapshot MUST explain each
 *     line of the diff in its body. "Recovered N units" is not an explanation;
 *     name the mini form and why the old verdict was wrong.
 *   - NEVER run `vitest -u` to make this green. A snapshot regenerated without
 *     reading it re-buckets a silent data-loss bug as an improvement.
 *
 * The oracle is IMPORTED from `editCoverage.ts`, never re-derived here. A
 * second copy would answer confidently and diverge silently — the failure mode
 * this corpus exists to detect.
