/**
 * _1057-denominator-base.spec.ts — SCRATCH PROBE. NOT A GATE. ([[P409]]: `_*.spec.ts`
 * is inert here — `vitest.config.ts` includes only `*.test.ts`.)
 *
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1057-denominator-base.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * #1057's done-when is stated against "~3006 lossless-refine offers on the grid". The
 * live tree measures 2967. `__p4c_base__/` is a pinned copy of parse/resolution/
 * serialize/model as of #1047 (P4c), so the same count runs on both.
 *
 * ⚠ THE BASE IS A WHOLE-MODULE SNAPSHOT, NOT A P4c ISOLATE. Everything that landed in
 * those modules since #1047 (#986 leaf work, #1064, #1070, #1086, #1087, #1055 …) is
 * folded into any difference. So a raw base-vs-live delta shows the figure belongs to an
 * older tree and attributes it to NOTHING. Two decompositions are therefore run:
 *
 *   (1) 2×2 FACTORIAL — {base,live} parse × {base,live} slotState. Splits the delta into
 *       "what opens and how it is projected" vs "what the control is willing to offer".
 *   (2) WHERE THE UNITS WENT — element / leaf / refused, both trees. An element unit that
 *       stops opening is a reach loss; one that MOVED to the leaf path is a reallocation.
 *       These read identically in an element-only count, which is how the first version
 *       of this probe would have mis-reported it.
 *
 * CONTROL ARM: the base and live copies must be shown to differ, else the probe compared
 * a module against itself and its silence would mean nothing ([[P410]]).
