/**
 * _1309-roll-subdivide-route.spec.ts — THROWAWAY INSTRUMENT. The roll's half of
 * `_1007-subdivide-route.spec.ts`: does subdividing a PIANO ROLL author, and does
 * the cost depend on the ROUTE rather than on the gesture?
 *
 * Run:
 *   npx vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts _1309-roll-subdivide-route
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Every corpus measurement the subdivide arc has produced was
 * posed of `parseStepGrid`. `_roll-subdivide-denominator.spec.ts` measured what
 * that leaves out: 244 minis (14.9% of the corpus) open as a roll ONLY and can
 * move, so no grid probe reaches them by construction, and a further 296 open as
 * both and were asked a GRID question. This is the first of the arc's three
 * questions posed of the other surface.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT A DEFECT HUNT. Nothing so far has observed the roll behaving wrongly; its
 * arithmetic is unit-tested (`resolution.test.ts`, roll 14). What is being settled
 * is what may be CLAIMED — whether the arc's conclusions generalise across surfaces
 * or are grid-only. If the roll reproduces the grid's answer, that is the finding.
 *
 * THE TWO ROADS, and only one is shipped. Taken from the grid probe's own analysis
 * and re-verified on the roll rather than assumed across surfaces:
 *
 *   ROUTE A (shipped)   parsePianoRoll(mini, k) -> placeNote
 *                       -> collapsePianoRollToDocument -> serializePianoRollWithExtent
 *                       `PianoRollGrid.tsx:184-190` wires exactly this through
 *                       `useGridModel` — parse / serialize / viewScale /
 *                       collapseToDocument — the same contract `SequencerGrid` uses.
 *   ROUTE B (probe)     scalePianoRoll(m,'double') -> placeNote
 *                       -> serializePianoRollWithExtent
 *                       A model-space rescale. `scalePianoRoll` has NO production
 *                       caller outside `resolution.ts`; its only other non-test
 *                       mention in the tree is a comment at `model.ts:617`.
 *
 * The grid arc learned this the expensive way — a cost measured through
 * `scaleStepGrid` was quoted as a fact about the product, and the shipped road
 * moved a fraction of it. So Route A is driven here from the first probe rather
 * than discovered after publishing a number.
 *
 * THE DISCRIMINATOR, both columns written BEFORE the run:
 *
 *                            ROUTE IS THE CAUSE        GESTURE IS THE CAUSE
 *   A vs B, same units       A far below B             A comparable to B
 *   A vs delete anchor       comparable                far above
 *
 * PAIRED, NOT TWO SWEEPS. Only units where BOTH routes wrote are compared, so a
 * difference cannot be a population difference. The unpaired remainder is reported,
 * never dropped.
 *
 * TWO THINGS DIFFER FROM THE GRID PROBE, and both are stated rather than papered over:
 *
 *   1. NO `regions` SPLIT. `GridWriteExtent`'s splice carries `regions` /
 *      `regionsReemitted`; `RollWriteExtent` is `{ path }` alone, deliberately —
 *      `serialize.ts:1506` says giving the roll a `regions: 0` "would state a
 *      measurement nobody took". So the grid's reconciliation split (splice with
 *      one source region vs many) has NO analogue here and is not faked.
 *   2. THE PITCH SET IS A STATED SUBSET of what the panel offers. `viewPlacesNotes`
 *      (`place.ts:138-142`) asks about the model's own pitches PLUS one padded row
 *      below the content. This probe asks only the model's own, so every placement
 *      it finds is one the panel also offers, and it can under-ask but never
 *      over-claim. Re-deriving the padded-row rule here would be a second oracle;
 *      the tree already records that sweeping the full padded range "changes the
 *      answer on 0 of 544 corpus rolls" (`place.ts:127`).
 *
 * GUARD, because this is where the grid arc lost a gesture: `scalePianoRoll` takes
 * `'double' | 'halve'` and vitest does NOT typecheck. `posedB` counts only asks where
 * the model VERIFIABLY doubled, and every denominator is printed.
 *
 * CONTROLS, because a clean reading from a detector never shown to fire is not
 * evidence. Both must fire, and both are asserted below:
 *   C1  the ×2 verification guard, asked of a DOUBLE-doubled (×4) model — must reject
 *       every unit, proving the guard protecting against a dead gesture can say NO.
 *   C2  a LEAF-projected roll offered a placement — must refuse every one, proving
 *       the placement gate discriminates rather than accepting whatever it is handed.
 *       (`place.ts:238` records leaf rolls refusing all 18,386 asks.)
 *
 * ⚠ C2'S FIRST DESIGN WAS REFUTED BY ITS OWN RUN, and it is kept below rather than
 * swapped out, because the refutation is the evidence that the arm is live. It offered
 * `placeNote` the pitch `zz9` on the assumption that an invalid note name would be
 * refused. It was ACCEPTED on all 538 units — correctly. `ifRollSpellable` asks whether
 * the model can be SPELLED, and mini-notation writes `zz9` back as a literal token, so
 * it round-trips. The gate decides structural admissibility (overlap, leaf refusal),
 * never pitch validity — which is the panel's job, via the row set it offers. So the
 * control was testing a proposition nothing in the code claims. It is reported as an
 * OBSERVATION, never asserted on, and it cost one run to learn.
 *
 * CALIBRATION. Nothing below may be read if these move: the population must
 * reproduce the committed denominator probe exactly — 597 rolls opening, 540 able
 * to double. If either moves, this instrument is measuring a different corpus and
 * its treatment columns mean nothing.
