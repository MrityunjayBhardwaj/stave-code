/**
 * engineEditOracle.ts — THE ONE definition of "a modelled edit survived".
 *
 * Extracted from `writer-reach.test.ts` (#1009) because a second consumer now
 * needs it: the writer census asks the SAME question of a different writer, and
 * two copies of an edit oracle are two oracles that can only agree with
 * themselves ([[PV192]]). The extraction is verdict-neutral by construction —
 * `writer-reach` calls this and read exactly 131 / 73 with no losses on the day of the
 * extraction. Both numbers have moved since, and never because a writer changed: 155 / 75
 * when the probe learned to advance past a silent bar (#1022), then 126 / 75 with 29 named
 * losses when the grid arm's duration axis was restored (#1026). What the sentence meant —
 * that moving this code must not move a verdict — still holds; what it must not be read as
 * is a claim that these two digits are the current ones.
 *
 * WHAT IT MEASURES, and it is deliberately narrow: delete ONE cleanly-singleton
 * note through the REAL writer, then re-query the emitted document through the
 * REAL engine, and require every bar to play the original minus that note.
 *
 * THE ORACLE IS THE ENGINE ON BOTH SIDES. `want` is what the original mini plays;
 * `got` is what the edited document plays. Never a re-parsed column grid —
 * `[~ 1@2]` and `[~ ~ 1@4]` are the same music at two resolutions and a column
 * compare would false-flag a faithful re-spelling ([[P301]]).
 *
 * "NO CLEAN PROBE" IS ITS OWN VERDICT, NOT A FAILURE. A fully-chorded pattern, a
 * non-integer per-bar width, or a writer that declines the delete are all
 * UNVERIFIED — neither reach nor a loss ([[PK59]] step 5). The census reports that
 * bucket separately and names which of the four reasons applied, because folding
 * it into either side is how an unproven unit becomes a proven one.

 * The equivalence key: (onset, duration, atom), on EVERY surface.
 *
 * DURATION IS NOT A PER-SURFACE CHOICE (#1026). This key used to take a
 * `durAware` flag that the grid set to `false`, commented "an onset instrument —
 * the grid has no duration axis". That sentence is true about what the grid PANEL
 * draws and it is not a licence for what the grid WRITER may alter: a view that
 * cannot show duration still must not change it, because "edits locally / no
 * silent data loss" is a property of the DOCUMENT, not of the panel. Under the
 * old key, 11 grid asks emitted writes whose surviving note had a different
 * length and every one of them scored as a clean transfer — including
 * `[bd ~]*2`, where the derived writer emits `~ bd` and the surviving `bd` grows
 * from 0.25 to 0.5. The comparison must span every axis the document carries,
 * not every axis the view draws.
 *
 * `collapses` is what genuinely IS per-surface, and it is about the view's
 * representational capacity rather than about which axes count:
 *
 *  - GRID (`collapses`): a cell holds a hit or it does not, so it cannot hold two
 *    IDENTICAL events at one instant. `hh(<3,7>,16)` superimposes euclid(3) and
 *    euclid(7) and plays 10 haps at 7 distinct instants; the grid shows 7 and a
 *    faithful re-emit plays 7. Comparing as a multiset would false-flag that.
 *  - ROLL: a duration-carrying MULTISET. Its projection is overlap-free by
 *    construction, so nothing is there to collapse and a multiset is exact.
 *
 * Measured over the corpus (#1026): the two spellings of the collapse — dedupe on
 * the onset key versus on the full key — pick out the same 11 asks, and dropping
 * the collapse entirely picks out the same 11 again. So `collapses` fires (4 grid
 * asks have a row to collapse, and the `hh(<3,7>,16)` control collapses 10 rows
 * to 7) but currently changes no verdict. It is kept as DEFENSIVE rather than
 * deleted: the hazard is real, silent, and a grid re-emit is entitled to collapse.
