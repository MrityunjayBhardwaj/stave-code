/**
 * ungatedOps.ts — THE PLACEMENT OPS MINUS THEIR SPELLABILITY GATE, kept in one place.
 *
 * ⚠ THESE TRACK THE CURRENT EDIT, THEY DO NOT FREEZE AN OLD ONE. The one axis they
 * control for is the GATE; everything else must move with production. So when #1064
 * phase 2 widened the grid clamp from the lane to the `,`-part, `ungatedToggle` widened
 * with it. Left lane-scoped, it would have gone on answering "would the writer have
 * taken it?" about a model the op no longer builds — every assertion still passing,
 * all of them measuring nothing.
 *
 * Since #1071 the production ops answer "could not apply" by returning their INPUT
 * by reference (`ifGridSpellable` / `ifRollSpellable`). That is the right shape for
 * production and the wrong shape for two kinds of measurement:
 *
 *  - a CONTROL ARM that needs to ask the writer itself, so that the gate is not
 *    comparing a derived predicate against the thing it is derived from
 *    ([[P370]] — a gate that cannot fail);
 *  - a HYPOTHESIS ARM that asks what a DIFFERENT rule would have made spellable.
 *    The gate refuses exactly the placements such an arm exists to rescue, so
 *    composing on top of the gated op measures nothing ([[P379]]).
 *
 * These are a deliberate second oracle used as a control, which is the one use
 * [[PV192]] permits: they exist to be compared against, never to decide anything.
 * Kept byte-for-byte in shape with the production ops minus the spellability
 * wrapper, so the only variable between arms is the gate itself.
 *
 * THEY LIVE HERE RATHER THAN IN EACH SWEEP because a second copy is how this
 * boundary keeps growing duplicated rules ([[PV247]]): `toggleCell` itself was
 * defined three times before #1048. Two callers is the point at which the copy
 * becomes a module.
