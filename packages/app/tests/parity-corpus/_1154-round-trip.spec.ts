/**
 * _1154-round-trip.spec.ts — PROBE (inert: `_` prefix + `.spec.ts`).
 *
 * CAN YOU UNDO YOUR OWN DELETE? Measured over the WHOLE corpus, not a hand-picked set.
 *
 * cont.198b found delete-then-re-add refusing 21 of 25 asks across 16 hand-picked leaf
 * units. Sixteen units chosen by hand is a SHAPE, not a rate — the same session had just
 * watched a proposal turn out to have zero population, so a figure that has never met the
 * full corpus is exactly the kind that should not be quoted. This re-derives it over every
 * grid-openable unit, with the non-leaf cohort alongside as the positive control: if the
 * probe cannot see a round trip SUCCEED somewhere, its zero means nothing.
 *
 * THE GESTURE, exactly as a user performs it:
 *   1. open the grid on the unit as written
 *   2. click a sounding cell OFF   → write → the document now says `~` where the note was
 *   3. re-open the grid on THAT document
 *   4. click the same cell back ON → write
 * and ask whether step 4 gives the bytes step 1 started from.
 *
 * Step 3 re-parses rather than reusing the model, because that is what the app does — the
 * panel is re-read from the document after every write. Skipping it would measure a model
 * the user never has.
 *
 * Every write is asked through `serializeStepGridWithExtent`, so each outcome is recorded
 * with THE PATH THAT SERVED IT rather than with a guess about which branch ran. The routing
 * discriminator is the measurement; the source text is not.

 * A byte compare cannot answer this question. The DELETE is entitled to re-spell what
 * it touches, so `<a b>` written across three padded lines comes back as one line, and
 * a re-add that faithfully restores the note into THAT document still fails `=== mini`.
 * The first cut of this probe scored 1711 such asks as broken; every sample inspected
 * was whitespace the delete had normalised, with the note itself perfectly restored.
 *
 * Four cycles rather than one because an alternation is only visible across cycles: a
 * `<a b>` arm that a round trip flattened would play identically in cycle 0 and differ
 * in cycle 1. Null (unreadable to the engine) is kept distinct from "differs" — an
