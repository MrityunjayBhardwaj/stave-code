/**
 * THE ROLL'S RESIZE, ASKED WHETHER THE DOCUMENT REOPENS AS WHAT IT WROTE (#1331).
 *
 * `roll-isolation.test.ts` already asks three questions of every resize — did an unnamed
 * note change, did the bytes spell, do the bytes parse. This defect passes all three. The
 * model still holds the sibling voice; the loss happens in serialize → parse, and the
 * bytes parse perfectly. They just come back one note short.
 *
 * So the property here is the fourth question, and it is the one the document actually
 * poses: reopened, does it hold the same notes? Measured at the lengths an ordinary drag
 * asks for (`d±1`), 1,099 of 10,960 asks fail it — stretching one member of a comma-stack
 * re-spells the group as `[g3@4 ~ ~]` and the sibling is gone.
 *
 * ⚠ THE DEFAULT WRITER IS UNCHANGED AND THAT IS ASSERTED, not assumed. `readback` is
 * opt-in because it parses and resize runs per pointermove (#1324 measured p99 549ms when
 * this ran on the hot path). The panel turns it on once, at gesture commit. The control
 * arm below pins the default path's lossy count so a change to the cheap rule cannot hide
 * behind the strict one.
