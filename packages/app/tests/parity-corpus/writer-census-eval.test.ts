/**
 * writer-census-eval.test.ts — THE WIDENED DENOMINATOR for the reach transfer
 * (#1009, epic #1007 phase P3).
 *
 * ── WHY THIS ARM EXISTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `writer-census.test.ts` measures the transfer over `mini-corpus.json`: 1500 real
 * minis, harvested under the OLD parse-side admission. That population is
 * comparable to the committed floors and to the 234 the epic quotes, which is
 * exactly why it is the calibrated arm — and exactly why it cannot be the only one.
 *
 * A re-measurement over the same population as before can only confirm. The rule
 * ([[PK59]] step 1, as amended) is to ask what the instrument EXCLUDES, widen to
 * the whole population the code serves, and **write the prediction against the
 * widened set expecting the number to fall** — the excluded cases are excluded
 * because they are hard.
 *
 * What the mini-corpus excludes: it is a snapshot of the strings the parse-side
 * walk found. The eval-first resolver (#1006) picks the content span from
 * EVALUATION, so for the same documents it can hand a writer a different string —
 * a binding's initialiser, a chained argument, a root literal. This arm re-derives
 * the ask population that way, from the 150 real tunes, and asks the same
 * counterfactual.
 *
 * PREDICTION, written before the run: the transfer rate FALLS here, because the
 * spans eval newly admits are bound references and chained arguments, which is
 * where shared leaves and long periods live. **If it comes back HIGHER, the
 * widening did not reach the hard cases and what it excluded has to be found**
 * ([[P343]]) — a gate that gets stronger when the hard cases are added was not
 * measuring them.
 *
 * ── WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED, AND THE CORRECTION IT FORCED ──────────────────────
 * The rate came back HIGHER: **82.6%** (413/500) against the mini-corpus arm's
 * 79.3%. The pre-committed response was to find what the widening excluded, and it
 * did: **this arm is not a superset of the mini-corpus arm — it is SMALLER.** 671
 * distinct minis against 1500, because the resolver answers exactly ONCE PER UNIT
 * (the content span) while the corpus harvest collected every mini it could find.
 *
 * So "widen the denominator" was the wrong description of this arm from the start.
 * It is not wide-vs-narrow; it is two differently-drawn samples of the same corpus,
 * and what it therefore buys is a ROBUSTNESS check rather than a harder test:
 *
 *   mini-corpus (parse-side harvest)  965/1217 = 79.3%
 *   eval-first, all resolved minis    413/500  = 82.6%
 *   eval-first, ONLY the 275 minis the parse snapshot does not contain
 *                                      73/93   = 78.5%
 *
 * ⚠ THOSE THREE FIGURES ARE PRE-#1019 AND ARE KEPT ONLY TO PRESERVE THE REASONING
 * ABOVE. Naming the `:`-variant (#1019) moved BOTH arms, because both run the same
 * writers over differently-drawn ask populations.
 *
 * ⚠ AND THE "current values" THAT USED TO SIT HERE — 1058/1217, 430/500, 75/93 —
 * HAD THEMSELVES DRIFTED, to 1055/1217, 427/500 and 76/93, because the duration
 * axis (#1026) moved both arms again. That is the third time this file's headline
 * figures went stale in prose while the test stayed green. They are no longer
 * written here: every one of them is now a pinned constant at the foot of this
 * file, asserted exactly, so it cannot move without failing (#1031).
 *
 * And it cost this file its headline conclusion: the eval arm no longer scores
 * HIGHER than the harvest arm, it scores marginally lower. So that ordering was
 * never a population effect — it was one naming hole falling differently across two
 * heavily-overlapping samples. What survives is the weaker, real claim: the two large
 * populations agree inside ~1pp and the new slice sits ~6pp below them.
 *
 * NOTE FOR WHOEVER CHANGES THE WRITERS NEXT — REVERSED AT #1031. This file used to
 * assert only loose bounds (`> 200`, `>= 142`), so it did not turn red when the
 * rate moved; it did not turn red for #1019, and it did not turn red for #1026
 * either. Every printed headline is now pinned to an exact literal. If you have
 * changed a writer, a reader or the oracle, EXPECT this file to fail — that is the
 * point of it. Re-derive the numbers (measure the new value, then re-measure the
 * OLD value on the current tree, because the difference from the recorded figure
 * is someone else's drift and belongs to them), and update the pins in the same
 * commit that moves them, saying which direction and why.
 *
 * The transfer rate is close to a property of the corpus, not of how the
 * asks were drawn. That is a weaker claim than the prediction wanted and a more
 * useful one than either arm alone could support.
