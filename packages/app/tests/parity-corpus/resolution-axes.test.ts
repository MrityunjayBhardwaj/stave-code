/**
 * resolution-axes.test.ts — THE INSTRUMENT for the resolution-model change (#1054,
 * Phase 1 of #1052). It changes no behaviour. Its whole job is to be able to tell
 * apart two worlds that today's gates cannot.
 *
 * ── WHY AN INSTRUMENT COMES FIRST ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Clicking a finer "Slots" target currently changes TWO things at once: the document
 * is re-spelled, and the grid redraws. After Phase 4 (#1057) it must change only the
 * second. A gate that cannot separate those two passes identically in both worlds and
 * therefore certifies nothing — which is the failure this boundary has produced more
 * than once (`can<Op>` predicting the writer, [[PV192]]; each op's A/B comparing an op
 * to ITSELF, [[PK64]]).
 *
 * So this records THREE INDEPENDENT BITS per (surface, unit, preset), and the point of
 * the design is that each comes from a DIFFERENT AUTHORITY:
 *
 *   document?  the WRITER   — `serialize(next)` byte-compared to the source we read
 *   layout?    the READER   — the column structure of the model the panel draws
 *   haps?      the ENGINE   — `queryArc` over the two SOURCE STRINGS
 *
 * Today a lossless refine reads (document ✓, layout ✓, haps ✗).
 * After Phase 4 the same click must read (document ✗, layout ✓, haps ✗).
 *
 * ── THE BIT MOST LIKELY TO BE VACUOUS, AND WHAT STOPS IT ──────────────────────
 * #1054 names it: if the haps bit is computed from the MODEL it silently restates the
 * layout bit under another name, after which the two move together forever and neither
 * can fail alone. `hapsChanged` therefore takes two `string`s and nothing else — there
 * is no model in scope for it to read, so the vacuous version cannot be written by
 * accident. Its independence is then PROVEN rather than argued, by the third control
 * arm below: a source edit that changes what the engine plays while leaving the model's
 * columns identical must move `haps` and NOT `layout`.
 *
 * ── FOUR THINGS THIS RECORDS THAT A SIMPLER SWEEP WOULD AVERAGE AWAY ──────────
 * 1. WHICH REFINE PATH a preset takes. `scaleStepGridTo` preserves note length and
 *    `quantizeStepGridTo` resets it (#1049, and the mechanism found in #1061). Folding
 *    them together makes a moved bit unattributable, so the path is part of the key.
 * 2. A REFUSAL IS ITS OWN OUTCOME. Refine past the cap, or a target that is not a
 *    power-of-2 ratio, returns the model unchanged. Recorded as "nothing changed" that
 *    is indistinguishable from a no-op, and Phase 4's diff becomes unreadable.
 * 3. THE COARSENING EXCLUSION IS COUNTED. #1052 scopes this work to refine only. An
 *    exclusion that is not counted reads afterwards as "we swept everything".
 * 4. BOTH SURFACES SEPARATELY, per #1052's standing rule for every phase.
 *
 * POPULATION: every distinct `mini-corpus.json` unit that opens the surface. Asserted
 * in the assertion itself rather than described in a comment, because a figure in a
 * comment has no gate and drifts ([[P343]] — a denominator that shrinks turns a gate
 * green over less material).
 * SAMPLING DEPTH for the engine: the model's OWN window, `bars` cycles — the same rule
 * `cell-duration.test.ts` states, and for the same reason.
