/**
 * 1117-refined-round-trip.test.ts — what a refined view owes the document when a
 * write comes back through it.
 *
 * #1117 admits two more model families to a refined view, so their writes now reach
 * `collapse*ToDocument` — the ÷k guard that asks "can what I am about to write be
 * said at the document's own resolution?". This gate holds the three properties that
 * question has, and it keeps them APART, because they fail for different reasons and
 * only one of them is currently clean:
 *
 *   CONTENT   the model that comes back plays what the document plays.
 *             MUST be exact. A failure here is music silently changed by how closely
 *             someone was looking — the worst outcome this seam can produce.
 *
 *   ARITHMETIC the model that comes back has the document's own column count.
 *             MUST be exact.
 *
 *   SPELLING  the bytes that come back are the document's own bytes.
 *             CLEAN as of #1121. It was not when this gate was written: the collapse
 *             de-scaled the model's cells but left the SOURCE description at the
 *             refined resolution, so the writer stopped recognising it and fell to
 *             the flat rebuild. 362 grid / 263 roll units came back re-spelled; all
 *             of them now come back byte-identical. The literals below are kept at
 *             their post-fix values for the same reason they were pinned at their
 *             pre-fix ones — a number that must be READ if it ever moves.
 *
 * AND THE CLAUSE THAT MAKES THE THREE ABOVE NON-VACUOUS — an UNEDITED round trip is a
 * weak question, because the writer copies unedited regions through verbatim at every
 * scale, so a collapse that did nothing at all would satisfy it. The fourth property
 * asks the form #1121 actually specifies:
 *
 *   EQUIVALENCE  the same edit, made at the document's resolution and made through a
 *             refined view, produces the same bytes. This is the one that forces the
 *             collapse to be a real inverse: an edit re-emits the region it touched,
 *             and the whole question is whether it re-emits it at the resolution the
 *             document spells or the one the user happened to be looking at.
 *
 * ⚠ THE EDIT IS DELIBERATELY ONE THAT STAYS ON THE DOCUMENT'S GRID — a cell the file
 * already spells, a note starting on a column it already has. An edit that uses a
 * column only the finer view has SHOULD spell the finer grid, and the collapse
 * declining is the correct answer there; mixing the two into one population would
 * make the equivalence unassertable.
 *
 * Shapes are named by the SOURCE STRUCTURE the model carries, not by the function
 * that produced it — `alt-whole` covers both the syntactic whole-cycle alternation
 * and the bar projection, which build the same shape and so write through the same
 * splicer. Naming it after one producer would be a claim the data cannot support.

 *
 * The middle column is what keeps the equivalence assertion honest: `diverged` being
 * empty means nothing if nothing was compared, and the population that reaches the
 * comparison is exactly the one an edit is admissible on at BOTH scales.
 *
 * `leaf` is absent by construction: a leaf-anchored model anchors each note to its own
 * source span and so refuses a refine outright, which means it never reaches this
 * sweep. Its absence is asserted by the shape-set equality above, not assumed.
 *
 * The `element` rows are the control: they are the family this change does not touch,
 * and they measured identically on `c12b8d0d` with these projections taught the scale
 * and without. They are pinned here so that if a future change to the collapse moves
 * them, it cannot be mistaken for a cost of the alternation work.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ELEMENT ROW MOVED, AND THE PIN IS WHY WE KNOW (#1120). Teaching the writer to
 * spell a held note across a `[…]` boundary took the grid's element path from 736/735
 * to 743/742 — seven units that used to refuse a finer view now draw one, and six of
 * those are reachable through the Slots control. The alternation rows and every roll
 * row are unchanged, so the move is attributable to that one writer change and nothing
 * else. Every correctness counter on the row stayed at zero: nothing was re-spelled,
 * no content changed, no width was wrong, and no collapse diverged.
