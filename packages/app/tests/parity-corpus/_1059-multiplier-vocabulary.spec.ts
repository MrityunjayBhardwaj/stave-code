/**
 * _1059-multiplier-vocabulary.spec.ts — WHAT SHOULD THE SLOTS PICKER OFFER?
 *
 * #1059 pre-registers one measurement and says to take it BEFORE designing the
 * control states:
 *
 *   > Measure how many of the 334 grid offers currently classed `quantize` convert
 *   > to free-zone offers if the picker offers MULTIPLIERS (×1, ×2, ×4) against the
 *   > derived resolution instead of absolute counts. Then decide the vocabulary on
 *   > that number.
 *
 * `RESOLUTION_PRESETS = [4, 8, 16, 32, 64]` are absolute counts — the right
 * vocabulary for a document op ("make this pattern 16 elements"), the wrong one for
 * a view derived from the pattern's own resolution. A 3-element pattern's clean
 * finer views are 6, 12, 24 and none of them is a preset, so every preset it is
 * offered is a rewrite.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A VOCABULARY QUESTION AND NOT A ZONE QUESTION ─────────────────
 * `freeZoneScale` is ALREADY general: its only shape test is `target % docSteps`,
 * so it admits any whole multiple and would hand back ×2 on a 3-element pattern
 * today if anything ever asked it for 6. Nothing does — `RESOLUTION_PRESETS` is the
 * only thing that names targets. So the free/writes split needs no change at all
 * and this measures the PICKER, which is the one layer that still speaks absolutes.
 *
 * ── EVERY STATE COMES FROM THE CONTROL ITSELF ─────────────────────────────────
 * `stepSlotState(model, target, canDrawView)` with the REAL prover, which is the
 * same call `SequencerGrid.tsx:229` renders the button from — never a re-derivation
 * of what it would have said. A gate that reconstructs a module's own decision from
 * its inputs is wrong in the permissive direction and its output cannot show it
 * ([[P433]] — this arc's most recent instance cost 208 mislabelled asks).
 *
 * ⚠ NOT A GATE. An instrument: it reports numbers for a product call. Its `expect`s
 * pin only what must not silently move under it.
 *
 * ⚠ THE SUITE DOES NOT RUN THIS FILE, and that is deliberate — `vitest.config.ts`
 * includes `*.test.ts` only, so the `_`-prefixed instruments stay out of the gate
 * run. To take the measurement again, point vitest at it with an include override:
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run \
 *       --config <(echo "export default {test:{include:['tests/parity-corpus/_1059-*.spec.ts'],environment:'jsdom'}}") \
 *       --minWorkers=1 --maxWorkers=3
 *
 * or copy `vitest.config.ts`, swap its `include`, and delete the copy afterwards.
 * ⚠ `--maxWorkers` WITHOUT `--minWorkers` aborts with a RangeError and collects
 * nothing, and `pnpm --filter X test --minWorkers=1` passes the flag to PNPM rather
 * than vitest — exit 1, zero tests. Grep the POSITIVE total; exit 0 proves nothing.
