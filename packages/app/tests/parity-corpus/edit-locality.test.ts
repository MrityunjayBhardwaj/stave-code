/**
 * edit-locality.test.ts — an edit must change only what it edits.
 *
 * THE LAW (the design doc's invariant B, "round-trip fidelity"): for any
 * modeled edit on a view, the document diff must be CONFINED TO THE EDITED
 * SPAN. Everything the user wrote elsewhere — their `*2`, their `!3`, their
 * groups, their spacing — is none of the edit's business and must survive it
 * byte-identically.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM `round-trip.test.ts`. That file measures
 * the UNEDITED open→write path: `serialize(parse(mini)) === mini`. It is
 * necessary and it is not sufficient — it can be satisfied completely without
 * fixing anything a user can see. An implementation that stores the source text
 * and returns it whenever the model is untouched scores a perfect round-trip
 * and still destroys the line on the first click, because the destruction
 * happens on the EDITED path, which that file never exercises. The two files
 * are the two halves of one property, and this is the half with the bug in it.
 *
 * WHAT AN EDIT ACTUALLY DOES TODAY (observed, `bd hh*2 sd cp`, one cell nudged
 * in the `bd` region — nowhere near the `hh*2`):
 *
 *     bd hh*2 sd cp   ->   bd bd hh hh sd ~ cp ~
 *
 * The `*2` is collateral. `useGridModel.mutate` writes `serialize(model)` over
 * the WHOLE mini range, and the model is a flat boolean grid that never knew
 * the `*2` existed, so every edit rewrites every element.
 *
 * THE ORACLE. The element boundaries come from krill — Strudel's own parser,
 * the same authority `parse.ts` consumes — and never from a second scanner
 * written here. A check is only worth the independence of its reference: a
 * hand-written table of expected outputs would encode the same beliefs as the
 * code it checks, and could not disagree with it.
 *
 * THE PROBE. For each mini the grid opens, flip the LAST column and assert the
 * source PREFIX (everything before the last top-level element) is untouched.
 * The last column belongs to the last element — columns run in time order and
 * so do elements — so every byte before it is, by the law, none of the edit's
 * business.
 *
 * `,`-stacks are covered by editing a lane of the LAST part, which makes the
 * prefix an entire neighbouring VOICE. That case is here because the first
 * version of this file skipped stacks — krill reports a stack as one top-level
 * node rather than a sequence, so they fell out of the probe silently — and a
 * real bug lived in exactly that hole: painting a cell into `bd sd, hh*4`
 * destroyed the `hh*4` next door. A gate that does not cover a shape is not
 * evidence about that shape, and its green says nothing.
