/**
 * #920 — the every-edit stress gate for `<...>`-as-element writeback, over the
 * real-world corpus. The shipped `edit-locality` gate edits only the LAST element
 * and checks only the prefix — a projection (PV197). This is the property it
 * projects: drag EVERY note / toggle EVERY cell, and assert both
 *   (1) no data loss — the output re-parses with the same note/cell count, and
 *   (2) locality — the changed byte span overlaps at most ONE top-level element,
 * asked of krill (an independent oracle), not of our own regions.
 *
 * This is the sweep that found two data-loss bugs in the roll's whole-cycle span
 * surgery (#916); it must run against the alt-element writer too.

    // trimmed a neighbour changed the document in a way the panel could not show, and
    // a view that cannot display an axis must not change it.

    // observed in the app on `s("bd hh*2 sd cp")`, where placing hh at column 1 halves
    // the kick's bar from two columns to one and writes `[bd hh] hh*2 sd cp`.
