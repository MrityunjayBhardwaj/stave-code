/**
 * THE CALIBRATION — the resolver measured over 150 real Bakery tunes.
 *
 * It lives in @stave/app because the CORPUS does, and it drives the resolver
 * and the headless eval harness from @stave/editor by source path, exactly as
 * `editCoverage.ts` drives the detectors — one oracle, imported, never a second
 * copy. The eval harness must stay in the editor package: it needs
 * `@strudel/tonal`/`@strudel/xen`, which are the editor's dependencies and not
 * the app's, and Node resolves those from the harness file's own location.
 *
 * The unit tests pin the RULE on shapes chosen to exercise it. This pins the
 * rule against real code, and it is the gate that licenses reading anything the
 * resolver says about documents nobody has hand-read.
 *
 * ── HOW TO READ THE HEADLINE, AND WHY IT IS NOT 100% OF ANYTHING ──────────
 * The calibration population is units the coverage harness already calls
 * `note`: `chunkDetect` found a mini string as the first literal argument of a
 * `note`/`n`/`s`/`sound` head call, and the notation parser round-tripped it.
 * For that population the harness's truth (`unit.miniRange`) and the disposal's
 * head-call arm are close to the same statement, so agreement there is a
 * REGRESSION FENCE, not evidence that the rule is right. What the rule can
 * actually get wrong lives in the shapes those units do not have — a control
 * argument, a bound reference, a root literal, a mid-chain override — and those
 * are pinned one-by-one in `miniSource.test.ts` with red-tests behind them, and
 * hand-read on the unoffered pool this file also counts.
 *
 * ── THE DENOMINATORS, SAID OUT LOUD ───────────────────────────────────────
 * This block once printed three figures against three different populations
 * without naming any of them: coverage counted over the 147 documents that have
 * units but printed against 150, exactness counted over the documents that
 * EVALUATED, and the unoffered pool counted over all 150. A gate that quietly
 * excludes the hard documents reads as a stronger result than it is, so each
 * number now states the population it is over:
 *  - coverage — every document, before any skip.
 *  - exactness — every known-content unit in all 150 documents. The parse walk
 *    serves the ones whose document did not evaluate; that is what a fallback
 *    is for, and excluding them measured the easy half.
 *  - presence — only the units in EVALUATING documents, because "is the span
 *    among the located haps" is not a question about a document with no haps.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND WHY EACH ONE CAN FAIL ───────────────────────────
 *  - eval coverage: reported and floored, WITH the documents it could not reach
 *    named. A sweep that silently stops reaching documents reads as a reach
 *    ceiling.
 *  - undeclared spans: 92, and the admission rule is LOAD-BEARING again. This
 *    line predicted exactly that, and got the reason backwards, which is worth
 *    keeping rather than quietly rewriting. It used to read 0 and said the class
 *    would return "the day the engine's missing string parser is fixed". The
 *    engine was never missing one — `StrudelEngine` has called
 *    `miniAllStrings()` all along (#1018). What was actually true is that the
 *    HARNESS had none, so removing its parser did not close a divergence, it
 *    flipped it: the instrument became more permissive than the engine and
 *    scored documents the live app threw on. Both now install the same rule, so
 *    single-quoted minis are parsed here exactly as the app parses them, their
 *    spans land in the STRING's coordinate space rather than the document's, and
 *    admission refuses all 92 of them. Coverage and exactness are unmoved by the
 *    change (142/150 and 538/538), which is what says the rule is refusing the
 *    right things.
 *  - exactness: every known-content unit resolves to exactly its known span. A
 *    disposal change that admits a control argument breaks this.
 *  - PRESENCE IS TOTAL, CONDITIONAL ON THE STATEMENT SOUNDING: this is the
 *    sharp one. Every unit whose content span is missing from the located haps
 *    belongs to a statement with NO located hap at all — because a bare pattern
 *    statement that is not the document's last never sounds (the transpiler
 *    returns only the last statement, and when `$:` collected anything the repl
 *    replaces the return with the stack). Not one unit is a case of "the
 *    statement sounds but this mini has no span". If that class ever becomes
 *    non-empty, the eval proposer has a real hole.
