/**
 * Where a Stage 2 control can actually WRITE, measured over real documents.
 *
 * `SignalSpans` carries the source coordinates of each leg, and its doc comment
 * quotes how often each leg is spelled. This test is what OWNS those numbers.
 * They were originally taken by a throwaway probe that read `ranged` and
 * `periodCycles` — proxies for spelling — and a number transcribed beside the
 * type it describes rots the moment either moves.
 *
 * ⚠ THE PROXIES AND THE SPANS ARE NOT THE SAME QUESTION, which is the reason
 * this measures spans directly. `periodCycles !== 1` says the chain HAS a rate;
 * `spans.rate` says a control may WRITE one, and it is deliberately null when
 * two rate arms compose — `sine.slow(2).fast(4)` has a well-defined rate and no
 * well-defined place to put a new one. So the span figure is a floor under the
 * proxy figure, never equal to it by construction.
 *
 * What the numbers are FOR: the share spelling NEITHER leg is the whole
 * justification for `captionEdit`'s insert path, which appends a call instead of
 * replacing one. If that share were zero the insert path would be dead code; it
 * is not, and this is the evidence.
 *
 * ⚠ Denominator is `loadCorpus` — the sweep corpus, NOT `ref/bakery-runs-inputs`
 * (329 by content) and NOT all of `.bakery-runs`. The three are not
 * interchangeable and a figure measured on one predicts nothing about another.
