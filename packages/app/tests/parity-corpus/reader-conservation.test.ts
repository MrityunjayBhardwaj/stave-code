/**
 * reader-conservation.test.ts — the readers DROP NOTHING (#1036).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE KIND OF GATE. Every other assertion about a reader checks
 * a VALUE: this pattern yields these atoms at these instants with these lengths.
 * No assertion of that shape can see a reader that keeps one of two real notes,
 * because the value it keeps is real — plausible on every input, on every axis, in
 * every existing test. That is not hypothetical: `readGridOnsets` resolved a
 * same-token `,`-stack to ONE of its two source leaves for the whole life of the
 * file, through three sessions specifically spent hunting for dropped axes, and no
 * test noticed. The axis-diff instruments could not find it either — they compare
 * the grid's reader against the roll's, and the field was present in both.
 *
 * What found it was COUNTING: over a 4-cycle window, 19375 occurrences played and
 * 19331 kept. Conservation is the property, so conservation is what gets pinned.
 *
 * THE STATEMENT, per surface: for any unit the reader ACCEPTS, the number of
 * records it returns equals the number of haps the engine played that a reader is
 * obliged to consider — one with an onset and a `whole`. A reader may REFUSE a
 * unit (that is a gate verdict, measured elsewhere); what it may not do is accept
 * a unit and silently return fewer notes than were played.
 *
 * THE ROLL IS THE CONTROL ARM, not a second subject. `readRollOnsets` pushes every
 * qualifying hap unconditionally — it has no dedupe guard and cannot drop one — so
 * its arm must read EXACTLY zero violations. If it ever reads non-zero, the fault
 * is in this file's hap counting rather than in the reader, and the grid arm's
 * zero would be worthless. A detector that cannot be shown to fire is not evidence
 * of absence, and a detector that fires on its own control is not evidence either.
 *
 * PROVEN TO FIRE (2026-07-26). Restoring the old dedupe guard and re-running turns
 * the grid arm red — at a 4-cycle window, 31 violating unit×cycle pairs and 19331
 * kept against 19375 played, the 44 dropped notes — while the roll control stays
 * at 0. Both halves matter: a detector that cannot fire is not evidence of absence, and one that also
 * fires on its conserving sibling is measuring its own arithmetic.
 *
 * POPULATION AND WINDOW ARE PART OF THE CLAIM, and are stated in the assertions
 * rather than in prose: the committed `mini-corpus.json` (1500 distinct minis
 * harvested from 360 real tunes — re-harvested at #1037 to include backtick minis
 * and to stop harvesting commented-out code), cycles 0-15. The totals are pinned to literals so
 * that a corpus refresh or a window change announces itself instead of quietly
 * re-scoping the guarantee — a figure produced at this boundary has three times
 * shipped carrying an unstated restriction, and a gate that only asserts ">= 0
 * violations" would be the fourth.
