/**
 * _1243-head-first-population.spec.ts — INSTRUMENT for #1243.
 *
 * THE QUESTION THE ISSUE ASKS, VERBATIM: "how many units repo-wide have a
 * content head, a surface that declines them, and a sibling surface that would
 * accept." If it is a handful, head-first stands and #1243 closes.
 *
 * Run:
 *   SWEEP=tests/parity-corpus/_1243-head-first-population.spec.ts \
 *     pnpm --filter @stave/app exec vitest run --config vitest.sweep.config.ts
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS RE-MEASURED RATHER THAN READ OFF THE ISSUE ────────────────
 * #1243 was filed while each grid still re-derived its own eligibility from the
 * HEAD (#1250), so "the grid would draw it" was not yet true for anything the
 * panel routed by content. That is fixed, which changes what the narrow fix
 * would BUY, though not the population itself — the corpus arithmetic below
 * runs through `parseStepGrid`/`parsePianoRoll`, which #1250 did not touch.
 * Stated so the two are not confused.
 *
 * ── NO SECOND COPY OF ANY RULE ────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Units and their statuses come from `unitsWithStatus` (the harness oracle the
 * corpus gates use); acceptance comes from the shipped parsers. The head→surface
 * mapping is the one thing spelled here, because `routeSurface` answers the
 * SILENT-head question and this probe is about the loud-head one — so it is
 * cross-checked against `unitsWithStatus`'s own verdict per unit, and the run
 * fails loudly if the two disagree.
 *
 * ⚠ NOT EVERY REFUSAL IS A ROUTING REFUSAL. A `note(...)` unit the roll declines
 * for `unstable-period` or a cap is a CAPACITY refusal — the grid accepting it
 * does not mean the grid is the right editor, it means the grid asks less. The
 * dump is therefore bucketed by the OWN surface's gate, because the narrow fix
 * ("fall through to the content check when the head's own surface declines") is
 * defensible for `wrong-surface` and indefensible for the rest.
