/**
 * 1240-resolver-anchor-agreement — the soundness condition for wiring the
 * resolver into a SYNCHRONOUS code path.
 *
 * ── THE PROBLEM THIS GATES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `resolveMiniSource` was calibrated with EVAL proposals in hand (#1015,
 * `miniSource-calibration.test.ts`). The product cannot have those:
 * `useActiveChunk` calls `detectChunk` on every cursor move, `chunkDetect` is
 * pure by contract, and `admitProposals` needs an `EvaluatedDoc` the engine only
 * produces asynchronously. So `chunkDetect` runs the PARSE proposer alone.
 *
 * Parse-only is not simply "eval minus some hits". It hands every literal
 * exactly ONE proposal, so the resolver's most-evidence-first ranking has
 * nothing to rank and degenerates to source order wherever a unit reaches more
 * than one `source` literal — and it then answers CONFIDENTLY and WRONGLY. That
 * is worse than refusing: a wrong anchor is a write to a literal the user did
 * not mean, and the count of resolutions looks identical either way. Measured
 * when this was built: parse-only and eval both resolve 148 of the 173-unit
 * unoffered pool — the same number — while 14 of them name a DIFFERENT span
 * (`"siren"` where eval says `"<[b4, g#4, e4, c#4]> …"`). A gate that counted
 * resolutions would have read 148 = 148 and called them equivalent.
 *
 * ── THE CONDITION ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * `MiniSourceHit.alternatives` is what separates them, and it separates them
 * exactly: of the 148, the 125 with no alternatives ALL agree with eval, and
 * every one of the 14 disagreements carries alternatives. So `chunkDetect`
 * refusing whenever `alternatives` is non-empty buys a wrong-anchor rate of
 * ZERO, at a cost of the 9 ambiguous units that would have agreed anyway.
 *
 * ⚠ THOSE FIGURES ARE THE UNOFFERED POOL; THIS GATE IS WIDER. The numbers above
 * come from the scoping probe, which asked only the 173 units that had no view
 * — the population the wiring was sized against. This file asks EVERY unit in
 * all 150 documents, because the invariant is a property of the disposal rule
 * rather than of that slice, and a gate scoped to the slice would go quiet the
 * moment the slice shrank (which is exactly what wiring the resolver does to
 * it). Over the wide population it reads 862 unambiguous / 0 disagreements /
 * 36 ambiguous, 18 of which would have agreed. Both denominators are named
 * because quoting one without it is how a coverage figure misleads ([[P549]]).
 *
 * That is the invariant here: **an unambiguous parse-only resolution names the
 * same span evaluation would have named.** It is not a property of the corpus,
 * it is the premise the synchronous wiring rests on — if a disposal change ever
 * makes it false, `chunkDetect` starts writing to wrong literals in the live
 * editor and nothing else in the suite would say so.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS NOT CIRCULAR ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 * The two sides are produced by genuinely different machinery: the eval arm's
 * candidate spans come from located haps the transpiler declared and the engine
 * played, the parse arm's from acorn walking literals. They share only the
 * disposal rule. So agreement is evidence, not tautology — and the 14
 * disagreements are the proof that this comparison can fail.
 *
 * The reciprocal figures are REPORTED rather than asserted: they are properties
 * of the corpus and will drift with it, whereas the zero is a property of the
 * rule ([[PV320]] — keep the count as the floor and the claim separate).
