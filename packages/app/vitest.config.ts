    //
    // The suite intermittently died with `Abort trap: 6` — a run that stops
    // with no failing test, which is indistinguishable from a regression. The
    // macOS crash report named it exactly: `node::OOMErrorHandler` →
    // `Heap::FatalProcessOutOfMemory`, a V8 heap exhaustion inside ONE worker
    // (the machine had 24 GB free). The default worker ceiling is 4288 MB and a
    // measured run peaked at 4367 MB in a single process — just past it.
    //
    // vitest 1.6's `ThreadsOptions` does not expose `resourceLimits`, and a
    // worker thread REJECTS `--max-old-space-size` in `execArgv`
    // (`ERR_WORKER_INVALID_EXEC_ARGV`). So the ceiling is raised where it can
    // be — `NODE_OPTIONS` on the parent, set by `scripts/vitest-guard.mjs`,
    // which `pnpm test` and `gate:editing:app` both run. That file carries the
    // full measurement and reasoning.
    //
    // ⚠ Running `vitest` DIRECTLY bypasses the guard and keeps the 4288 MB
    // default — which is the configuration the failure was observed on.
    //
    // ⚠ Lowering `maxThreads` would make this WORSE, not better: fewer workers
    // means more files each, and files-per-worker is exactly what accumulates.

    // App-package projection helpers are pure functions that import
    // PatternIR types from @stave/editor. Real Strudel parsing in tests
    // means we still need the @strudel transitive imports to resolve via
    // vite-node — mirror the editor's stub + inline pattern.
